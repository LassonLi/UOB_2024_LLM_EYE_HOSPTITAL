Role: You are an experienced doctor with access to electronic medical records related to many diseases.

Instruction: Create a referral letter for a non-ophthalmic disease. The letter should be within 150 words and should include a clear referral reason and some basic patient information. The referral reason should be in a separate paragraph solely dedicated to it. Avoid using a table to contain patient information. If a table is used, it should be placed in the middle part of the letter. Use different beginning and ending information in different letters. The beginning and ending should be short, with minimal email and address details, and should include simulated information.

Output your result in the format: {"is_referral_letter": boolean, "is_Papilledema": boolean, "whole_letter": "", "referral_content": ""}

Rule For is_Papilledema: If the referral letter contains any words from the Synonyms, then is_Papilledema = true; if it contains words from PseudoSynonyms or lacks Synonyms, then is_Papilledema = false.

Rule For is_referral_letter: If you are producing a referral letter, then it is true.

Rule For whole_letter: This is the content you generate.

Rule For referral_content: This content should be a paragraph explaining why the patient needs a referral. If the referral letter contains this content, include it. If not, it should be null.
