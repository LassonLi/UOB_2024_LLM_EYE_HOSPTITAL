Mr. Smith has been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss over the past two months.\n\n**Referral Reason:**\nBased on the patient's symptoms and initial examination findings, there is a high suspicion of Crohn's disease. Lab tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers, and a recent colonoscopy showed ileal inflammation. Given his family history of inflammatory bowel disease, further gastroenterological assessment is necessary.\n\nYour expertise is needed to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan to manage his condition.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Emily Johnson\nXYZ Medical Clinic",
