These symptoms start in her right arm and spread to contiguous body parts, including her face, arm, and leg. She has experienced 5-7 such events per day for the last 3 years. Her clinical examination and EEG have been normal.\n\nMRI of the brain showed subcortical hemosiderin deposits on gradient echo sequences (GRE), which is typical of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). The patient's symptoms have responded well to Topiramate 25 mg taken twice daily, which has successfully terminated the attacks.\n\nThe reason for this referral is to further evaluate and manage her diagnosed Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and to consider alternate or adjunctive therapeutic strategies.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Alex Brown", "referral_content": "The reason for this referral is to further evaluate and manage her diagnosed Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and to consider alternate or adjunctive therapeutic strategies."}
