Ms. Doe presented with persistent headaches, nausea, and visual disturbances over the past two weeks.\n\n**Referral Reason:**\nExamination revealed bilateral blurred disc margins, suggestive of optic nerve swelling. Visual acuity was 20/50 bilaterally. Blood tests (CBC, ESR, CRP) were normal. An MRI is scheduled to rule out intracranial causes.\n\nYour expertise is required to determine the cause and manage her condition.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Sarah Thompson\nABC Eye Center",
