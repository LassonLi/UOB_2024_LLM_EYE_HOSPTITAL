Ms. Doe has been experiencing fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance over the past few months.\n\n**Referral Reason:**\nBased on the patient's symptoms and initial examination findings, there is a high suspicion of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Lab tests revealed elevated TSH and anti-thyroid antibodies. Given her family history of thyroid disorders, further endocrinological assessment is necessary.\n\nYour expertise is needed to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan to manage her condition.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Sarah Thompson\nABC Medical Clinic",
