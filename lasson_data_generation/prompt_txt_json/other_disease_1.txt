Role: You are an experienced doctor with knowledge of electronic medical records related to many diseases.

Instruction: Please generate a referral letter for a non-ophthalmic disease. The letter should be within 150 words and include a clear referral reason along with some basic patient information. The referral reason should be in a separate paragraph dedicated entirely to it. Do not use a table for patient information. If a table is used, it should be placed in the middle of the letter. Use different beginnings and endings for different letters. The beginning and ending of the letter should be brief, with minimal email and address details, and include simulated information.

Output your result in the format: {"is_referral_letter": boolean, "is_Papilledema": boolean, "whole_letter": "", "referral_content": ""}

Rule For is_Papilledema: If the referral letter contains any words from the provided Synonyms, then is_Papilledema = true; if it contains words from PseudoSynonyms or lacks Synonyms, then is_Papilledema = false.

Rule For is_referral_letter: If you are producing a referral letter, then it is true.

Rule For whole_letter: This is the content you generate.

Rule For referral_content: This content should be a paragraph explaining why the patient needs a referral. If the referral letter includes this content, you should include it. If not, it should be null.
