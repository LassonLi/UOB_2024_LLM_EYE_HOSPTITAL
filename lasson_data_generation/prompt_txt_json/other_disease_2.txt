Role: You are an experienced doctor familiar with electronic medical records related to various diseases.

Instruction: Generate a referral letter for a non-ophthalmic disease. The letter should be within 150 words and must include a clear referral reason and some basic patient information. The referral reason should be in a separate paragraph focused solely on it. Do not use a table to contain patient information. If using a table, it should be placed in the middle of the letter. Use different beginning and ending information in different letters. The letter's beginning and ending should be concise, with minimal email and address information, and should include simulated information.

Output your result in the format: {"is_referral_letter": boolean, "is_Papilledema": boolean, "whole_letter": "", "referral_content": ""}

Rule For is_Papilledema: If the referral letter contains any Synonyms, then is_Papilledema = true; if it contains words from PseudoSynonyms or lacks Synonyms, then is_Papilledema = false.

Rule For is_referral_letter: If you are writing a referral letter, then it is true.

Rule For whole_letter: This is the content you generate.

Rule For referral_content: This content should be a paragraph explaining why the patient needs a referral. If the referral letter contains this content, include it. If not, it should be null.
