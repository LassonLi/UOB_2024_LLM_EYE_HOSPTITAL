Patient 1: A 64-year-old man with a left inferior visual field deficit and headache. The CT angiography showed a left superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm (4 _ 5 mm) ().
"A 15-year-old boy came to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day present-ation of abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and vomiting. On examination, the patient was found to have pain and tenderness on the right side of his abdomen. (Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and intraoperative details for all patients are described in .) SARS-CoV-2 was detected via the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) of his nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Empiric intravenous (IV) antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole was started and he was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy."
"A 13-year-old male patient had a history of progressive subungual melanosis in the hallux of the right foot for over 4 years, but no pseudo-Hutchinson signs (Fig. A). After resection, the tumor was pathologically diagnosed as a subungual melanocytic nevus. The defect of the nail matrix was repaired with a lateral toe pulp island flap based on the plantar digital artery (Fig. B and C). The patient was monitored for 16 months and made a full recovery after surgery (Fig. D__)."
"Case 1: An eight-year-old, healthy, African-American female patient presented with her mother at the department of Pediatric Dentistry at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) complaining of asymptomatic swelling in the labial mucosa of her lower lips. No significant medical history or known allergies were reported. Examination revealed a 0.70 cm silver blue, translucent swelling opposite the right mandibular canine. The mother reported that the swelling started four months before and changed episodically in size and color. They denied any previous trauma or habit of lip biting ()."
"A 39-year-old female patient underwent surgery under local anesthesia following the diagnosis of concomitant exotropia. In the month following the surgery, the patient complained of a foreign body sensation. A conjunctival cyst was visualized at the middle nasal side of the right eye, with severe conjunctival congestion (). Tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops (Tobradex®, SA Alcon-Couvreur NV, Belgium) were applied 4 times daily for 1 week, together with deproteinized calf blood extract eye gel (Shenyang Xing Qi Ophthalmic Limited by Share Ltd, China) for 2 weeks. The conjunctival cyst resolved in the next 1 month."
"A 17-year-old male from Misiones, Argentina who was born to healthy, non-consanguineous parents. After an uneventful pregnancy, he was referred for genetic testing after being diagnosed with ALS as an infant; he presented with a normal karyotype and CGH array test results. After years of being misdiagnosed, a genetic counselor suspected he might have been affected with MWS due to his facial features, congenital cardiomyopathy and the presence of generalized refractory epilepsy. He also presented with bilateral hearing loss, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and severe neurodevelopmental delay with the absence of speech."
"Patient 1 is a 31-year-old Jordanian female with a history of a recurrent and itchy eruption involving the mid- to lower back, lateral chest wall, and the nape of the neck. This resolved with net-like pigmentation (Figures and ). The occurrence of the eruption was linked with fasting in Ramadan, in addition to travels to North America. No other medical problems were identified."
"The first patient was a 66-year-old female with history of seizure and bedridden for the last three months presenting with hypotension, chest pain and dyspnea. The symptoms begun in the last seven days. Primary echocardiography showed severe RV dysfunction with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) of 75 mmHg. The patient received reteplase and during 7 days of admission had no major bleeding or any complications. SPAP had reduced to normal (25 mmHg) in a follow-up echocardiography."
"A 55-year-old female patient consulted the neurologist because of vertigo and tinnitus. Clinical examination revealed an obvious palatal myoclonus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, and T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed focal hyperintensity and expansion of both medullary olives (Figure ). Neither enhancement was seen following contrast administration, nor restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging. Based on the clinical symptoms and radiologic findings, a diagnosis of HOD was made. The etiology for this case remains unknown since no history of infarction, hemorrhage, tumor, or trauma was present."
"A 16 year old girl presented with severe headache and visual loss, upon further questioning she also had primary amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. An MRI [Fig. ] identified an apoplectic suprasellar tumour with a prolactin of 10,919 miU/L. After a week of treatment with cabergoline her vision had not improved so endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery (ETSS) was performed. Post-operatively, her vision returned to normal and she had no further galactorrhoea. 6 years later she has had no recurrence and has a normal prolactin. Histology confirmed pituitary apoplexy with expression of prolactin in a diffuse pattern. The Ki67 proliferation index was low."
"A 91-year-old man was referred to our dermatology clinic for a 3 cm _ 2 cm ulcerative nodule at his chin (). The lesion had been rapidly growing since approximately 2 months. Biopsy showed skin metastasis originating from a gastric adenocarcinoma. The patient had no fever and did not experience night sweat or weight loss. Computed tomographic scanning of the whole body revealed a gastric tumor with blood vessel infiltration, peritoneal carcinomatosis, pulmonary metastases with pericardium infiltration, and multiple disseminated subcutaneous metastases. The patient refused therapy and died a month after diagnosis."
"The second case was a 41-years-old female with a WHO°II diffuse Astrocytoma (IDHmt, no LOH 1p19q, mMGMT) that underwent gross total resection (GTR) and also was in an excellent physical status (KPS 90%). This case represents a high-risk Astrocytoma situation based on the inclusion criteria of the RTOG 9802 trial []."
"A 58-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy, presented with left foot swelling and minimal pain. There was no history of trauma. Radiograph () demonstrates multiple healing stress fractures involving the diaphysis of the second, third, fourth and fifth metatarsals."
"Case 1 is a 44-year-old male with no significant medical history before being diagnosed with HCV genotype 1b in 2014 (Table ). Before starting our treatment, his viral load was 10,400,000 IU/mL. The strategy SOF+RBV+PEG-IFN was given. The course of treatment was 12 weeks. He had a rapid virological response (RVR) with undetectable viral load at week 4 that remained undetectable for the remainder of 10 weeks of SOF-based triple therapy. The strategy SOF+RBV+PEG-IFN was stopped after the 12-week therapy. A sustained virologic response (SVR) was observed. The viral load remained undetectable until SVR24 (Table )."
"A 43-year-old female patient underwent skin-sparing mastectomy (Fig. ). A pedicled TRAM flap was performed to reconstruct the breast mound, and a modified C-H flap was used for the 1-stage nipple reconstruction. No complications were observed. The final height of the reconstructed nipple was similar to that of the contralateral nipple."
"Case 1: Vancomycin\nThe patient is a 64-year old male who was hospitalized 3 days ago while on vacation in Florida for an infection in a wound on his leg. Further evaluation revealed MRSA in the wound. In addition to home meds for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, patient was placed on vancomycin with peak and trough targets."
"A 76-year-old woman with malignant melanoma of the upper gingiva underwent subtotal maxillectomy and neck dissection of the right side. Six months after tumor resection, two zygomatic implants were inserted into bilateral zygomatic bones. After another 6 months, second-stage surgery was performed and two dental implants were placed in the anterior region of the maxilla. However, the position and depth of the dental implants were inappropriate for the final prosthesis. Therefore, the two anterior implants could not be used for support. The zygomatic implants and prosthesis have remained stable for 3 years since functional loading (Figures _)."
"Patient A is a 45-year-old Caucasian male. He has no history of cancer in his family and is asymptomatic.\nFollowing the recommendations of the USPSTF, the AAFP, the NCI, the CDC, the ACS, and the AUA, clinicians may not recommend PSA-based screening for patient A. However, following the recommendations of the NCCN, the NCI, and the CDC, the risks and benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer may be discussed with patient A for him to make an informed decision about PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.\nCase Study 2"
"CASE 1: the first case was a 28- year-old female with MDD (depressed mood, weight loss, and psychomotor retardation, loss of energy, and insomnia for more than 1 month). She was started on 75mg sertraline daily but started to suffer from bruxism and jaw spasm in the second week of receiving the medication. She stopped taking sertraline because of its side effects and immediately visited a psychiatrist because of her depression and bruxism. Again, she was prescribed 75mg sertraline and 25mg quetiapine. Her bruxism improved after 5 days, and she remained symptom- free throughout the following month."
"A 43-year-old female presented with a history of right-sided chest pain. She has been diabetic for the past 4 years and hypertensive, and has been on treatment. She had a history of primary amenorrhoea, which was never investigated previously. On examination, the patient was 155 cm tall, weighed 58 kg, blood pressure and secondary sexual characteristics were normal, and systemic examination showed absent breath sounds on the right side with mediastinal shift to the right."
"Patient 1. A male patient in his late 80s with arterial hypertension underwent repeat aortic valve replacement due to a paravalvular leak and cardiac decompensation. After surgery, he developed severe nosocomial pneumonia. Bronchial aspirates grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the empirical antibiotic treatment with meropenem was adjusted to ceftazidime. After moderate respiratory improvement, the patient__ condition deteriorated and he developed liver failure with jaundice and renal insufficiency. Twenty-three days after surgery, additional bronchial aspirates were sent for microbiological investigations and BCC was detected after 24 hours of incubation. Despite treatment with ceftazidime and tobramycin, the patient died from multi-organ failure."
"We herein describe a representative case of T790M-positive conversion. The patient was 73 years-old male with EGFR-mutant (L858R) NSCLC. He received erlotinib as the first-line therapy for 1 year. After progression, rebiopsy was performed using bronchoscopy. T790M was negative, then ABC-therapy and carboplatin plus pemetrexed were administered as second- and third-line chemotherapies. After further progression, rebiopsy was carried out again to the same lesion and procedure. T790M was converted to positive, and osimertinib was initiated. Partial response was confirmed, and TTF was 12.2 months (Figure )."
"Patient 1 was 86_90 years old with hypertension, diabetes and previous sigmoid colon cancer, and he visited the ED with a 30 min history of right hemiparesis. His NIHSS score was 17. The MTT map from PCT showed a perfusion delay in the whole left MCA territory with occlusion of the left distal portion of the main stem of the middle cerebral artery (M1) on CT angiography (CTA). The average values of the right and left cerebral rSO2 were 63.29 and 60.64%, respectively. He was treated with endovascular treatment (EVT) and reached the complete recanalization state."
"Case 1: 65-year-old male, with a penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) on the descending\nthoracic aorta. On the CT angiography (), it seemed to start right after the origin of the left subclavian\nartery, extending to the descending thoracic aorta, with a maximum diameter of\n57 mm.\nPatient was selected for endovascular treatment. The initial planning suggested\nthat the endoprosthesis could be anchored in Zone 3[ with the free flow zone over the left\nsubclavian artery."
"Patient A was a 15-year old male referred for immunological investigation because of IgM deficiency, subtle hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent stomatitis aphthosa and recurrent respiratory tract infections such as sinusitis and bronchitis (Table ). He suffered from pneumonia at the age of 6, but otherwise had an uneventful medical history. He was the child of healthy unrelated parents of Austrian origin, a healthy brother was 10 years old.

He had a history of a swelling that intermittently increased in size and restricted shoulder movement. He was a poultry worker by profession. His socio-economic status was poor. Ultrasonography (USG) of his chest wall showed a small cystic lesion of 0.5 _ 0.5 mm in the left-side of his chest wall with adjacent heterogeneous muscle; this indicated a possibility of left-sided chest wall intramuscular cysticercosis or an old hematoma. FNAC yielded 1 ml of granular, whitish fluid-like material (Fig. a, b)."
"A 51-year-old woman who experienced massive intraventricular hemorrhage due to presence of a post-central parasagittal AVM, Spetzler & Martin grade 3, underwent surgery (Figures and ). In this case, we performed right frontoparietal craniotomy and approached the AVM via right interhemispheric route (). However, through the delay map, visualization of the precise structure of the AVM was not possible due to depth of the nidus and angle of the surgical approach (); moreover, due to swelling of the brain, exposure of the AVM was unstable."
"In September 2015, a Minnesota woman aged 35 years returned from Somalia and sought medical care for a painful abdominal wound. Staphylococcus aureus and a coryneform isolate (identified as C. diphtheriae via MALDI-TOF and confirmed as toxin-producing) grew from the wound culture (). The patient was not tested for C. diphtheriae carriage. Throat and nasal swabs from four asymptomatic household contacts were obtained both before and at least 24 hours after a prophylactic course of penicillin; all cultures were negative for C. diphtheriae. The patient and household contacts were unimmunized but refused diphtheria toxoid__ontaining vaccines."
"Patient 1 is a 5-year and 1-month-old Japanese boy. He was suffering from severe neonatal asphyxia which required mechanical ventilation since birth.

"A 72-year-old man underwent left upper division segmentectomy because a ground-glass neoplasm was found in the left upper lobe (A). The lesion was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), TisN0M0, stage 0 (B). AIS is a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the survival rate after resection is reportedly 100% []. Three indels in the noncoding region of the SFTPB gene were detected (). The detection of noncoding indels in a case of such early, well-differentiated lung cancer suggested that noncoding indel mutations occur in the early phase of tumor evolution."
"A 66-year-old male was initiated on vancomycin IV for a MRSA prosthetic knee infection. Due to an increase in serum creatinine, vancomycin was switched to ceftaroline 300 mg IV every 8 hours (creatinine clearance of 22 mL/min) on hospital day 2.

Her calcium/creatinine clearance ratio was < 0.01 and she was a carrier of the inactivating (R220W) mutation in the CaSR gene. She experienced muscle cramps and muscle aches and poor memory. Furthermore, she suffered from paresthesia in her extremities, uneasiness and osteoporosis of the spine, with a BMD T-score (mean of lumbar vertebrae, L1-L4) of -3.1 prior to cinacalcet treatment."
"A 60-year-old male patient who had participated in CABG 4 years previously (LIMA-LAD, SVGA-RCA) underwent repeated coronary angiography because of chest pain and a positive stress test. The angiography revealed an unligated thick side-branch of the left mammary artery with a high run-off, which probably contributed to the string sign of the main branch of the mammary graft (Figure ). The possibility of an intervention for the occlusion of the side-branch arose, but the significance of the original LAD lesion was questionable, and the patient later became free of angina due to aggressive medical therapy."
"Case 1: Congenital pseudarthrosis forearm\nThe patient was an 8-year-old boy who suffered from congenital pseudarthrosis forearm type II on both the radius and the ulna. After resection and Ilizarov external fixation/traction, the discrepant 8-cm-long space between the 2 sides was repaired. A secondary free fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap was then harvested from the contralateral side and transferred to the affected side to cover the tissue defects (Figs e)."
"A 32-year-old woman with a history of psychological problems spent 1 year in an adolescent psychiatric unit and received psychotherapy for an eating disorder. Acts of DSH were carried for 7 years between the ages of 14 and 21 years, including cutting with objects such as glass, and blades and self-poisoning. All cuts were made to her left nondominant upper and lower arm alone, leaving her with numerous scars. Scar reconstruction was carried out on her left forearm."
"A 48 year-old woman with several discrete granular corneal deposits visited our clinic with her daughter for evaluation of corneal dystrophy. Her 23 year-old daughter, determined to be a GCD2 R124H heterozygote, had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 20/20 in both eyes and showed no corneal deposit (). The patient had no history of glasses or contact lens wear. Upon reexamination six months later, the daughter showed one small corneal deposit in the right eye (white arrow, ) and none in the left ()."
"A 77-years-old female was referred to our clinic for evaluation of worsening heart failure. She had no history of international travel. During etiological evaluation of heart failure, echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40% with a multilobular cystic structure localized to intramyocardial left ventricular apex (). Computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis () and screening of other organ involvement including brain, lung, and liver were negative for cystic echinococcosis. Serum indirect hemagglutination assay test for Echinococcus granulasus was positive. Thus, diagnosis of isolated cardiac apical cystic echinococcosis was confirmed. The patient was recommended surgery, however, patient refused the surgical operation."
Sixty-years-old man without any symptom was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma of lung detected by sputum cytology. He had smoked with 1.5 packs for 45 years. Tumor located at the spur of right B6 and intermediate bronchus. ILBT was performed with 20 Gy in 4 fractions followed by EBRT of 40 Gy in 18 fractions. CT based dose distribution showed that 95% of the clinical target volume receives more than 90% of the prescribed dose (Figure ). No remarkable acute toxicity and no recurrence were observed for a year.
"A left scrotal mass was detected in a 5-month-old baby boy. Ultrasonography confirmed the mass to be a 2 cm lesion, and an orchiectomy was carried out. On histological examination, the tumour was solid with regions of cystic spaces (Figures and ). Amphophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders and an extensive fibrocollagenous stroma were identified (). The lesional cells were positive to inhibin (), confirming the sex-cord stromal nature of this neoplasm. This patient was the only male diagnosed with GCT in our series. Twenty years post-operatively he is doing well, with no evidence of recurrence."
"Patient I.1 was a 37 year old woman with a long-standing history of recurrent rhino-conjunctivitis. At the age of 4, she had several episodes of otitis, sinusitis and bronchitis. At age 16, she had an episode of meningococcal septicaemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and skin complications. Later, she suffered from an acute arthritis episode. Infections severity declined with age. Her mother (I.2), sister (I.4) and brother (I.5) were also studied."
"A 57-year-old Chinese woman presented to our hospital for evaluation of an approximately seven-year history of pain around the right ankle joint and medial side of the middle foot. The pain worsened during ambulation. A physical examination revealed flattening of the medial arch of the right foot and mild tenderness at the talonavicular joint, but the hindfoot was in a neutral position (Figure ). Our patient underwent weight-bearing X-rays (anterior-posterior and lateral views), computed tomography (CT), and MRI scans (Figure ). Conservative treatment failed, so we performed autografting and talonavicular joint arthrosis with two compressive screws (Figure )."
"A 19 year old male patient with depression, neuropathic pain and delayed sleep phase disorder presented after addition of melatonin to his current regimen of citalopram, nortriptyline, and oxycodone with what he described as severe sedation. Samples of the patient__ melatonin, together with samples of another lot of the same product and of other melatonin products, were all tested to show cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 inhibitory activity in vitro. Because citalopram is metabolized by CYP2C19, our study team suspects a combined pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic mechanism of interaction which has not previously been documented. (See )."
"A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented with several symptoms characteristic of Cushing__ syndrome, including moon face and central obesity, during treatment for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was diagnosed as Cushing__ syndrome caused by AIMAH due to autonomous production of adrenal cortisol, which was accompanied by suppressed serum ACTH levels (<5.0pg/mL) and a loss of cortisol circadian rhythm. She underwent laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy because of her overt Cushing__ symptoms. The operative procedure in this case has been described by Shinbo et al. []. Cortisol replacement therapy was started immediately upon completion of surgery."
"The patient was a 71-year-old female with past history of pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple) performed at an outside hospital for a pancreatic mass eleven years prior to the current report. A diagnosis of benign inflammatory pancreatic mass of undetermined etiology was made. She presented at our institution for evaluation of hypertension; her serum creatinine was within normal range at 0.56 mg/dL (0.4_0.9 mg/dL). Computed tomography showed a 2.5 cm, circumscribed, enhancing mass in the right mid kidney near the hilar. This mass was presumed to represent a renal carcinoma and a nephrectomy was performed."
"A 13-year-old girl had skin patches over buttocks and upper thigh involving bilaterally for 3 years duration. They were asymptomatic, hypopigmented, oval or irregular, well-defined, size ranged from 1_6 cm diameters. There were vitiligo-like lesions on buttocks."
"A 15-year-old baseball player suffered repeated LBP which was so severe that he experienced sleep disturbances. CT images revealed terminal-stage spondylolysis on the right side and laminolysis on the left side (Fig. ). Although the patient was treated with conservative treatment such as a hard brace, the LBP did not resolve. Therefore, surgical intervention was performed. Six months later, bony union was obtained and the LBP was resolved, and the patient returned to baseball."
"A 51-year-old female, who was taking a cytotoxic DMARD (methotrexate) and codydramol and smoked 20 cigarettes per day, had slightly delayed wound healing. Half the sutures were left for a total of 3 weeks as the wounds were not considered clinically ready for suture removal in one area at 2 weeks."
"This case is a 20-year old girl with progressive loss of vision and cafe-au-lait spots on her skin.\nIn the axial T1-weighted MR image of the orbits, bilateral thickened optic nerves which were isointense with brain parenchyma were detected (). In the post-contrast axial T1-weighted MR image, bilateral optic nerve gliomas without involvement of the chiasma were seen ().\nNF1 with bilateral optic nerve gliomas was the diagnosis. Histologically, optic nerve gliomas are juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas seen in up to 30% of all NF patients. 10% of all optic nerve gliomas are associated with NF[]."
"Case 1: A 52-year-old man presented with a five-year history of a mass on the palmar aspect of the right index finger. He claimed to have no history of trauma. On examination, the mass was hard, indolent and located at the level of the middle phalanx.\nAntero posterior and lateral radiographs of the right index finger demonstrated a dense mass approximately 1.5 cm in size. The mass extended from the palmar aspect of the second phalanx. There was cortical erosion, but no abnormality of the underlying bony architecture ()."
"A 20-year-old woman presented with right hip pain radiating to the knee from one year ago. The pain tended to worsen at night, woke her up and was relieved by asprin, but after a while the pain increased again. The plain radiograph of the hip revealed no abnormalities but CT scan showed a sclerotic lesion with a central nidus in the cortex. In radionuclide scan, an increased uptake was detected in the same region. This type of osteoid osteoma is the most common type regarding the location of the lesion (cortical) and the involved bone (femoral) ()."
"A 4-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with severe back pain. CBC revealed pancytopenia and anemia. Back pain should always be considered pathologic in the pediatric age so the patient was sent to the radiology department for thoracoabdominal radiography. As can be seen, multiple dorsolumbar-collapsed vertebrae are detected (). Bone marrow aspiration confirmed the diagnosis of ALL."
"57-years-old male presented with swelling over the left wrist since 3 years. No history of trauma, fever. Past history: no history of tuberculosis, diabetes, and hypertension.\nPulse-78 beat/min BP-128/70 mmhg.\nNo pallor, cyanosis, clubbing, edema, and lymphadenopathy\nThree swellings over dorsal aspect of the left wrist: soft in consistency, nontender, noncompressible, and mobile at right angles to the plane of the wrist joint.\nRespiratory system: AEBE. Cardiovascular system: S1 S2 present. Abdominal examination: NAD. Central nervous system: NAD."
"The first case (patient 1) was a 65 year old female, initially admitted with acute renal impairment and hypocalcaemia. Upon admission her creatinine was 610 μmol/L (), with a corrected calcium level of 2.99mmol/L. Her urine Bence Jones protein (BJP) showed positive and a skeletal survey showed lytic lesions at the proximal humerus and scalp. A serum electrophoresis was completed and showed elevated IgA levels of 10.3g/L and serum FLC of 7220 mg/L (Lambda), (). A bone marrow biopsy revealed a high plasma infiltration of >80%."
"This 31-year-old woman exhibited a fixed left head tilt and turn with minor limitation of cervical range of motion since childhood. Her forceps-assisted birth by vaginal delivery was not associated with perinatal injuries. During childhood, she reported persistent head tilt to the left. She had headaches and back pain presumably from compensatory efforts at straightening her neck posture. There was no sensory trick or abnormal posturing of other body segments. Palpation of her neck musculature revealed a non-tender, taut fiber within the left SCM. She had limitation of right head tilt (see Video, Segment 1, Supplementary material; Figure )."
"Abdominal enhanced CT was conducted in a 63-year-old male due to the space-occupying location in the hepatic left lobe and the presence of cholecystolithiasis, as confirmed by an ultrasound examination. The bilateral renal veins extended out a large thick vascular shadow downward. They were accompanied by the downward abdominal aorta at the bilateral sides of the abdominal aorta, which branched into the iliac veins at the lumbar 5 vertebral level. Over the right renal vein level, the bilateral renal veins extended out as a normal running IVC (). This condition was diagnosed as double IVC."
"A 48-year-old male was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in August of 2011 for further examination because of the mass in the left parotid region. The mass was soft, non-tender and did not adhere to the skin. Ultrasound examination revealed a nonhomogenous hypoechogenic mass with anechogenic areas measuring 21_12 mm. Examination by fine needle aspiration cytology was not performed. The patient underwent parotidectomy without radiotherapy. The patient was alive with no tumor recurrence or metastasis at 16 months of follow-up."
"A 65-year-old Chinese man underwent total thyroidectomy and bilateral neck dissection with 131I treatment after that for papillary thryoid cancer in a local hospital. The papillary thryoid cancer extended to perithyroid soft tissues (pT3) with bilateral neck lymph node metastasis (pN1b). Chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan was not performed that time. Seven months later, a mass in his lung was found without any symptoms in physical examination."
"30-year-old man who was involved in a motor vehicle accident, resulting in a high voltage electrical injury to his face. After multiple conventional reconstructive surgeries, he underwent full face transplantation."
"A 70-year old female came to our clinic complaining uncontrolled asthma for 10 years. Spirometry showed obstructive lesion (FEV1=94.9%, FEV1/FVC =71.08%) with 5% bronchodilator (BD) response. PC20 of methacholine was 3.8 mg/ml. Chest CT showed diffuse bronchial wall thickening with tree in bud sign. Treated with clarithromycin for 1 month, FEV1was improved from 64.9% to 84.2% without asthma medication."
"The patient that carries the R29X mutation is a 27-year-old woman with generalized dystonia, which affects her arms, trunk (mildly), and both feet. She also has marked oromandibular dystonia with protrusion of the tongue. Her symptoms began around the age of 7. Initially, her leg was affected, then her handwriting, and, at the age of 11, her speech was involved. Although her tongue was markedly affected, swallowing was preserved. There was no family history."
"A 74 year old male patient presented with a temporal tumor with slight and diffuse contrast enhancement in T1-weighted MRI. T2-weighted MR-signal however revealed mass of approximately (app.) 35 cm3 ().\nFor both DTI and HARDI+CS-based fiber tractography, we found a fiber bundle, reaching from LGN to the visual cortex. However, DTI-based fibers were slender and diffusely orientated. HARDI+CS-based tractography, however displayed a more solid fiber bundle, representing the OR without significant looping of Meyer's loop (ML). Still, all three parts of the OR in relation to the ventricular system are reproducible with both methods (, row 1)."
"A 58-year-old woman presented for delayed autologous left breast reconstruction after mastectomy. A CTA was obtained to confirm the suitability of the thoracodorsal vessels as recipients for free tissue transfer. The vessels were patent but embedded in large amounts of surgical scar, with marked perivascular fibrosis (). As a result, the operative plan was changed and a pedicled TRAM (transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous) flap was performed successfully (as the patient did not desire rib resection for internal mammary vessel exposure)."
"A 38-year-old male with no past history of malignant melanoma presented with a gradually enlarging nodule on his back. A physical examination revealed that the nodule was black and measured 35_30 mm in diameter. The left axillary lymph nodes were enlarged. Computed tomography demonstrated multiple nodules in the liver, which were clinically suspected to be metastatic lesions. A total resection of the back nodule and the left axillary lymph nodes was performed."

He showed mild eczematous dermatitis on the face and upper extremities and significant lichenified eczema on the nape and upper back (). He also showed symptomatic allergic conjunctivitis, but had no family history of atopic disorders."
"The parafoveal area of the left eye of a 53-year-old man with no history of ocular or systemic diseases was examined by AO-SLO, and capillary image was constructed from video recorded for 2 s (). Capillaries were brilliantly visualized using elastic image registration (), comparably to early-phase fluorescein angiography (FA) images obtained using Heidelberg Retinal Angiography 2 (Heidelberg Engineering) (), while capillary images constructed without elastic registration were rather noisy and blurred ()."
"A 68-year-old man presented with macroscopic hematuria. The diagnostic ultrasound revealed a bladder tumor. The Computed Tomography (CT)-scan showed no prevalent metastatic lesions, while an ectopic left pelvic kidney was discovered (). The biopsy showed a high grade muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Radical cystoprostatectomy with extended lymphadenectomy was performed with conversion to an ileal pouch (). Twenty-one lymph nodes were resected. The final pathology showed a pT2aG3 urothelial carcinoma and multiple sites of urothelial in situ carcinoma. There are no signs of metastatic disease 1.5 years after cystectomy."
"A 77-year-old woman presented with progressive cognitive decline associated with psychiatric symptoms. Later gait ataxia appeared and myoclonus was observed in the extremities. Pyramidal signs were observed terminally. Examination of CSF 14-3-3 revealed strong positivity, with a normal cell count and moderately elevated protein (64 mg/dl), while the EEG did not show periodic sharp waves or triphasic components. MRI was not performed. She died after a 12-month illness in April 2010. Clinically sCJD was suspected. No mutations were found in the PRNP gene; the codon 129 was MM."
"A 77-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented with a growing mass in the right testis of 3 months duration. A computed tomographic scan revealed a soft tissue mass, measuring 12 cm in diameter, in the right scrotal sac. The mass showed low signal intensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Radical inguinal orchiectomy was performed because of suspected malignancy."
Patient 1 was a 27 year old woman who had a CD4 count of 65 at time of acute measles. MIBE onset occurred 3 months after acute measles. Measles virus PCR was positive on brain biopsy tissue. Brain virus was compared with acute virus from blood taken 3 months previously.
"The patient is a 55 year old gravida 2, para 2 with a chief complaint of postmenopausal bleeding. Her past medical history is significant for morbid obesity (BMI 40), type II diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. CT scan showed heterogeneity of the uterus and bilateral hydrosalpinx, with no evidence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent an endometrial biopsy and a subsequent robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The post-surgical course was unremarkable and the patient was discharged on post-op day 3."
"Another male patient aged about 65 years old presented with a giant filtering bleb at the superior limbus in the right eye, eight years after cataract extraction with intraocular implantation. The cyst measured 10 mm _ 5 mm prolapsing through the palpebral aperture which had tendency for spontaneous rupture with trivial injury (). The best corrected visual acuity was 20/200 and 20/40, respectively, in both the eyes. Ocular movements and dilated fundus examination were unremarkable with normal intraocular pressure. Internal wound gape was seen on gonioscopic visualization of the angle structures. Unfortunately patient refused the surgery."
"Case 2 (P2, ) is a 12 years old boy. He was born as the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents of Portuguese origin. Developmental delay was noted at the age of 18 months. He presented with hypotonia and slight facial dysmorphism. Fingers were long and thin. Brain MRI was normal. To date, he displays moderate mental retardation (IQ 43) and obesity (BMI>>P97). Periods of auto-aggressive behaviour and repetitive movements occur."
"Case 1: Testicular Schistosomiasis with No Clinical Suspicion. An 84-year-old Brazilian man with a history of prostate cancer underwent bilateral orchiectomy for androgen-ablation therapy. In gross description, testicular skin color, consistency, and weight were usual. Histologic sections of the surgical specimen showed bilateral hypospermatogenesis and numerous calcified eggs of S. mansoni (). Henceforth, this case has been presented as an incidentaloma in surgical specimen of bilateral orchiectomy for treatment of prostate cancer."
"A Twenty-five-year-old male reported cleaning his injured left knee with a brush usually used to clean the aquarium, which resulted in infiltration and subsequently visible crusts together with two subcutaneous resistances caused by M. marinum. The patient was initially treated with clarithromycin. Subcutaneous resistance did not lessen after nine weeks; therefore, treatment was continued with ethambutol for an additional nine weeks."
A 75-year-old gentleman with prior history of rectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis treated 3 years earlier with a panproctocolectomy underwent a surveillance abdominopelvic CT scan. Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no abnormality. A chest radiograph performed 7 months later for chest symptoms revealed a 2 cm left midzone opacity. Review of the prior CT scout confirmed it to be visible. Subsequent CT of the chest and biopsy confirmed it to be a squamous cell bronchogenic carcinoma ().
"Patient 1 is a 39 year old man diagnosed with PNH. The patient suffered from intermittent episodes of hemolysis associated with abdominal pain on a background of chronic hemolysis. The PNH clone size was quantitated at 90% (type III) measured in 2003 by flow cytometry in the neutrophil and monocyte series. He commenced treatment with eculizumab 3 years ago and since then has been relatively stable, with significant reductions in symptoms and acute hemolytic episodes. Two blood samples were obtained from this patient approximately one year apart (1_1 and 1_2 in tables)."

Examination was significant for severe proximal weakness in bilateral lower limbs and 2_2 cm palpable nodule in lower left lobe of thyroid."
"A 9-year-old girl suffered a left knee hyperflexion injury, resulting in avulsions of her anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL/PCL). This was managed with ACL/PCL reattachments via an anterior arthrotomy. Post-operative radiographs (Figures \n and\n) show conventional metaphyseal femoral, fibular and tibial growth arrest lines, but also an intra-epiphyseal distal femoral epiphyseal __rrest silhouette_ (Figure \nC)."
A 29 year old woman with a history of right ovarian cystectomy for endometriosis and severe adhesion syndrome was given 1500 mg cefuroxime intravenously during OR. Two bilateral endometriomas were seen and were not punctured. She became pregnant but later miscarried. During the second cycle cefuroxime was again used for prophylaxis during OR and the endometriomas were not punctured. She did not get pregnant.\nOne month later she was hospitalized for an 8 cm pelvic abscess that required surgical drainage after her clinical status had improved with intravenous antibiotics.
"The first case was a male patient aged 76 who had a consultation for a syncopal event documented in Holter monitoring as being atrioventricular (AV) block Mobitz type II. Echocardiogram was normal. A VVIR pacemaker was successfully implanted in the patient, followed by 3 years with suitable stimulation and sensed parameters. The patient died from lung cancer. The second patient was a 72 year-old male who was admitted for presyncopal events documented as being complete AV block. Echocardiogram was normal. A VVIR pacemaker was successfully implanted and he has been followed up for 5 years with good functioning parameters."

Upon MDCT evaluation he was found to have right lower pole segmental artery aneurysm. Further it also showed clots in pelvi calyceal system (PCS). There were no residual calculi and hematoma. These findings matched with findings on CA. A coil embolisation was performed, following which the hematuria settled (\n)."
"A 39-year-old male presented with a palpable mass in the right side of the scrotum. There was no history suggestive of urinary infection, genito-urinary tuberculosis or epididymo-orchitis. On local examination, a mass was identified in the right testis which was 2_1.5 cm in size, firm in consistency and well-marginated with smooth swelling. The overlying skin and surrounding adenexa appeared normal. Serum levels of AFP and β-HCG were within normal limits. Scrotal ultrasound revealed a solid mass in the epididymal body of the right scrotum that was hypoechoic compared with the testicular parenchyma."
"A 62-year-old female presented with a 3 cm breast lump. The overlying skin was soft and could be easily pinched over the mass (Figure ). However, on pushing the lump medially and upward, an obvious depression appeared on the overlying skin (Figure ). After a mastectomy, the cut surface of the tumor showed normal fat between the tumor and skin, with no tumor invasion of the fat histologically (Figure )."
"A 13-year-old boy presented to our hospital with hemianopsia on the left side and increased intracranial pressure. MRI showed an expanded tumor that encroached the third ventricle and posterior circulation with hydrocephalus (). The tumor was totally removed via the orbitozygomatic approach (). Postoperatively, he was able to continue his school life with hormone replacement therapy."
"A 54-year-old woman with no previous history of smoking was clinically diagnosed with NSCLC (cT2N2M1b, stage IV). A histopathological analysis of biopsied tumor tissue revealed SCC. IHC confirmed positivity for p40 and p63, negativity for TTF-1 and napsin-A (FIGURE ); ALK protein was overexpressed which was confirmed via IHC ALK rearrangement. The patient received first-line chemotherapy with four cycles of a combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin which did not suppress rapid tumor growth. The chemotherapy regimen was interrupted and replaced; the patient accepted crizotinib as second-line treatment and showed SD but relapsed after six months."
"Case 1__ previously healthy 6-week-old male with no history of hospitalization or receipt of antibiotics, presented to the emergency department with fever. His white blood cell count was elevated at 21,600/ml and a 2 + urine leukocyte esterase at the time of emergency visit. The patient was admitted for a rule-out sepsis workup and the patient was started on empiric ceftriaxone. Urine cultures grew 103_104 cfu/mL Escherichia coli and 103_104 cfu/mL SCV Escherichia coli. It was felt the urine culture did not support the diagnosis of UTI, and no additional antibiotics were indicated. The patient recovered fully."
"A 30-year-old male with BB injuries at multiple sites and an entry wound at the glabella presented for ophthalmic evaluation within six hours of injury. An NCCT scan was suggestive of a metallic FB in the anterior orbit, adjacent to the left medial rectus. On surgical exploration, the FB could not be retrieved, and a coexisting lower canalicular injury was repaired with silicon tube intubation. The postoperative CT scan was suggestive of posterior migration of the foreign body. No further intervention was attempted. The BCVA was 20/20 OU, pre- as well as post-operatively. No extraocular motility limitations were seen."
"A 54-year-old woman (patient 1, Table ) presented with an unacceptable facial deformity after repeated surgery for resection of a malignant ameloblastoma (Fig. a).

"The 4-year-old female proband (III1, ) was the first child of the family born at 40 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 2,600 g from non-consanguineous, healthy parents. There was no significant family history. Other family members including her younger brother (III2, ) did not show any obvious symptoms or signs. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Blood samples were collected from the proband and her family members after written informed consent was obtained from the parents."
"A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with gastric lymphoma and received chemotherapy. He subsequently developed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and started TB medications. He presented with vomiting and 80-pound weight loss. Endoscopy revealed a pyloric ulcer resulting in outlet obstruction () and proximal gastric ulcers. Attempted placement of a jejunal extension to a percutaneous gastrostomy tube by interventional radiology was unsuccessful due to severe pyloric narrowing. He was deemed a poor surgical candidate and remained on total parenteral nutrition and in respiratory isolation (, available online at )."
Patient 1 was a 16-month-old male child. His parents sought treatment in our hospital 5 months after being diagnosed with developmental delay and thrombocytopenia.
"Patient 1 was a 64-year-old male with stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nreferred to our institution for Mycobacterium abscessus right knee PJI after management at an outside institution failed. He underwent resection arthroplasty, and a static ALBC spacer was inserted. His activity was toe touch weight bearing following this surgery. He had 1 year of combination systemic antibiotic therapy, but his inflammatory markers remained elevated. Due to the concern for persistent infection, the spacer was resected, and systemic antibiotics\nwere extended for 3 more months. He underwent delayed reimplantation\n4 months later and was doing well at 2 years of follow-up."
"A 52-year-old man with COVID-19 was treated for 17 days and had negative results in two consecutive viral RNA tests. On the first day at hospital, chest CT showed scattered ground-glass opacities with air bronchogram and bronchovascular thickening (). On the sixth day, the lesions expanded, and consolidations were seen in the ground-glass opacities (). On the 13th day, the lesions continued to expand, and more consolidations appeared (). On the 18th day, both the consolidations and the ground-glass opacities were reduced ()."
"A 47-year-old man reported the presence of an irregularly pigmented, asymmetric skin lesion, of 0.7 mm in diameter, on his back that had appeared at an unspecified time before. He did not complain of other concomitant ailments and had no clinical history of significant disease.

Patient had received first dose of COVID-19 vaccine 10 days prior to the FDG PET-CT.\nAlong with temporal association with history of vaccination, the presence of a normal fatty hilum in normal-sized lymph nodes led to our decision to report vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy. No pathological lymphadenopathy was seen elsewhere."
"A 2-month-old female patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of bilious vomiting and abdominal distention. Plain abdominal X-ray showed small-bowel obstruction. Due to the worsening of the clinical manifestations, the patient then underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy without any further imaging examination. A volvulus of fibrous tissue of the vitelline duct and MD were found (). Subsequently, a segmental small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. The patient recuperated gradually, and on postoperative day (POD) 4, the patient was discharged from the hospital uneventfully."
"The healthy younger adult (YA1) was a 25-year-old man (PSQI=5 and ESS=3) who did not report any sleep disorders. One day of YA1 data, including wrist temperature, AX3 data, and sleep onset or offset detected by Mi Band 2, is shown in . The sleep period and wake period can be distinguished using AX3 data, which shows that YA1 was mostly static with a relatively high and stable wrist temperature during sleep. The sleep onset and offset detected by the Mi Band 2 align well with changes in AX3 and wrist temperature data."
"The first patient was female in her 30s, who underwent a transtibial ACLR in 2011. At presentation in 2019, she complained of instability since one year, which was probably developed during fitness exercises and jumping, without history of a clear distortion. Testing her knee showed Lachman 1+, and Pivot Shift grade 2 with a recognizable feeling. Physiotherapy had not been effective so far. Plain X-Ray and MRI showed an intact ACL graft with steep orientation of the graft ()."
"A 50-year-old man enrolled with baseline CD4+ T-cell count of 1.957 _ 109/L and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (free T4) levels. Four weeks after the first infusion of cemiplimab (0.3 mg/kg), TSH of 0.02 µg/mL and free T4 of 2.73 ng/dL were consistent with hyperthyroidism (Table ). Mild fatigue was the only symptom reported. Repeat laboratory tests at week 5 and consultation with an endocrinologist confirmed thyroiditis (Table ), assessed as probably related to cemiplimab. Both TSH and free T4 normalized by week 24 without medical intervention. Fatigue resolved, and no new symptoms were reported."
"13 years old Indian boy presented with healing vertex ulcer, seizure and features of raised intracranial pressure []. CT imaging showed chronic osteomyelitis of frontal vault with underlying epidural mass causing midline shift. Scalp lesion biopsy proved actinomycosis.

The tumor was pT1bN0M0 stage I (Fig. a)."
"A seventy-six-year-old female was examined due to four years of __emory problems_. She increasingly had to keep memos and frequently repeated the same questions. According to the results of the neuropsychological testing, she had incipient dementia, with a profile more compatible with a frontal or frontal-subcortical syndrome (decreased attention and concentration and executive function) rather than the typical hippocampal amnestic syndrome (). Neuroimaging showed frontal__rontoparietal atrophy and asymmetric hippocampal atrophy (a). Biomarker assessment showed decreased Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and increased both _P-181 and _T, compatible with AD."
"Case 1__ystemic Ni allergy syndrome [].\nA 48-year-old woman presented with an inflamed esophagus. Ni allergy was diagnosed through patch testing. A Ni-free diet reversed symptoms while an oral Ni challenge induced adverse gastrointestinal effects. An oral desensitization therapy with slowly increasing amounts of Ni led to a complete reversal of symptoms. This case illustrates how metal-containing foods may cause systemic symptoms in metal allergic patients. It is an indication that oral desensitization may work similarly to hypo-sensitization for protein-related allergies, for example to pollen."
"A 45-year-old man received a diagnosis of MS () in 2012 and was started on teriflunomide and then from April 2020 with Ocrelizumab with radiological and clinical stability, as confirmed in November 2020.

"A male patient aged 10 years with mental retardation reported to our out-patient department with the chief complaint of decayed tooth. Extraoral examination revealed brachycephaly, oblique palpebral fissure, depressed nasal bridge, short neck, and gap between toes, short broad hands with simian crease and lip incompetence [Figure __.\nIntraoral examination revealed a high arched palate with crowding of teeth [], and macroglossia. These phenotypical features were analyzed and were found to have complete manifestations of Down's syndrome such as abnormal facial and skeletal features[] and mental retardation.[]"
"A 2-month-old girl born at term was referred to our clinic with a protuberant\nhemangioma on face, impinging on the superior right eyelid (). Propranolol was introduced, and the lesion reduced in\nsize and had largely healed within 6 months (). This infant had an eye examination and impairment of visual function,\nstrabismus, astigmatism or amblyopia were ruled out. At the age of 9 months, she\ndeveloped a red telangiectatic macula in the previous hemangioma area (). It is being planned to taper off\npropranolol after the child is 1 year and 6 months of age."
"A 65-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of atelectasis, and he had a history of recurrent hemoptysis and pneumonia for a few years. The broncholith was impacted at RB9, and there was inflammation of the surrounding mucosa on bronchoscopy. We removed the broncholith using a tripod forcep and the inflammation subsided afterwards ()."
A 27 year old female presented with total scalp avulsion (stage III defect) and intact periosteum. We did skin grafting immediately. Early post operative results were good with 100% graft take [].
"Patient 1 was a 46-year-old, 68.2 kg male. He underwent right tibial graft surgery due to an oroantral fistula.() Fracture occurred when he jumped from a truck 20 days after surgery.() Noninvasive reduction and fixation were performed for 56 days (, ), and the fracture was completely healed after six months.()"
"The first patients was a 27 year old female who has been referred because of Anemia and Leukopenia and during follow up due to Anemia continuity and refractory anemia, she underwent BMA and BMB and had MDS criteria ().\nBesides repeated blood injection along with supportive and therapeutic measures she had been followed up and during a 7 month period, she had a surgery because of Breast mass and she was diagnosed as breast cancer. Patient underwent chemotherapy and Anemia and Cytopenia has been completely resolved after the completion of treatment."
"A 19-year-old female presented with 2 mm MRD1 on both eyes, which appeared to be worse due to hooding of excess skin causing effacement of the lid margin. Excess skin and muscle were excised through the incisional method, which also resulted in adhesion-like septated tissue around the septum being freed up. The MRD1 measurements at 3 months postoperatively were 5 mm on both eyes ()."
"A 72-year-old male with recurrence of an atypical meningioma, involving both frontal convexity and superior sagittal sinus (SSP). A partial removal of the bifrontal mass with residual tumor in the SSP, with transoperative SF administration, showed strong evidence of dural and tumoral dye enhancement [Figures and ]. Dural removal at the surrounding meningioma site was also enhanced by SF; there was evidence of meningioma presence in the histological analysis []. Cytogenetic analysis showed sexual chromosome Y deletion. The patient had a good neurological outcome."
"A 38-year-old male presented with vague epigastric pain. MRI (1.5 T) axial FIESTA images [] showed superior mesenteric vein (SMV) swirling around superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which is suggestive of midgut volvulus. This was confirmed by plain CT [Figure __. Coronal FIESTA images [Figure and ] showed prominent duodenal loop that returned to right side of the abdomen (suggestive of volvulus); coronal T2 fat-saturated images [Figure and ] showed jejunal loops on right and ileal loops on the left of abdomen (suggestive of malrotation)."
A 12-year-old boy reported with a chief complaint of pain with respect to upper anterior tooth since 3 days. The patient was in good general health. Extra-oral examination revealed no significant findings. Intra-oral examination revealed a comparatively wider maxillary right central incisor with a deep anatomic pit on palatal surface []. The tooth was tender on percussion and did not respond to thermal and electric stimuli. The periapical radiograph revealed type II DI with open apex and periapical pathology with respect to maxillary right central incisor []. Endodontic treatment was started immediately.
"A 32-year-old male with biopsy-proven sarcomatoid carcinoma involving the right middle lobe was evaluated by MRI.[] shows an example of the right middle lobe malignant mass suspicious of pericardial invasion, a finding confirmed at surgery. In this case, T2-weighted images using a BLADE TSE/PROPELLER FSE technique and ECG-gated double inversion-recovery FSE images were particularly useful in characterizing disease extent."
"A 27-year-old male presented with hair loss from the scalp since 6 months. Itching and slight burning sensation was present. It was progressive, covering almost entire vertex area extending to the parietal areas. Examination revealed well-defined purplish plaques with atrophy of skin [].\nTrichoscopy showed perifollicular scales (black stars), diminished follicular ostia and white dots (red stars). Blue-grey dots (yellow arrows) around the follicular structures were seen as a __arget_ pattern [].\nHistopathology of a lesion showed infundibular hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, bandlike infiltrate of lymphocytes with sparing of interfollicular areas, which are consistent with diagnosis of LPP []."
