Ms. Doe has been experiencing persistent headaches, blurred vision, and transient visual obscurations over the past two weeks.\n\n**Referral Reason:**\nExamination revealed bilateral pseudopapilledema with features suggestive of drusen. Visual acuity was 20/50 in both eyes. Baseline blood tests, including CBC and ESR, were normal. An MRI of the brain and orbits is scheduled to investigate potential intracranial causes.\n\nYour expertise is needed to determine the underlying cause and manage her condition to prevent further complications.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Emily Johnson\nXYZ Eye Clinic",
