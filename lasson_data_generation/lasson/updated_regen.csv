Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer our shared patient, Mr. Arthur Clark, DOB: 01/12/1980, for further evaluation and management. Mr. Clark has been under our care for chronic respiratory issues.

Despite adherence to current treatment protocols and lifestyle modifications, Mr. Clark's symptoms have progressively worsened. His recent spirometry results indicate a significant decline in pulmonary function, suggestive of potential chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

Kindly see him for a specialist evaluation to determine the best course of action. I believe a more intensive investigation, including possibly imaging and more advanced pulmonary function tests, might be necessary.

Six months after tumor resection, two zygomatic implants were inserted into bilateral zygomatic bones. After another 6 months, second-stage surgery was performed and two dental implants were placed in the anterior region of the maxilla. However, the position and depth of the dental implants were inappropriate for the final prosthesis. Therefore, the two anterior implants could not be used for support.

    A 72-year-old man underwent left upper division segmentectomy because a ground-glass neoplasm was found in the left upper lobe (A). The lesion was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), TisN0M0, stage 0 (B). AIS is a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the survival rate after resection is reportedly 100% []. Three indels in the noncoding region of the SFTPB gene were detected (). The detection of noncoding indels in a case of such early, well-differentiated lung cancer suggested that noncoding indel mutations occur in the early phase of tumor evolution.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer Mrs. Jane Doe, a 65-year-old female with a history of dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease. She previously lost vision in her right eye due to Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) and has been experiencing left scalp tenderness despite treatment with low-dosage glucocorticoids.

The reason for this referral is the confirmation of a GCA relapse. TA CDUS revealed bilateral halo signs and an intima-media thickness (IMT) of 0.7 cm. Although after six months of treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ), inflammatory markers have normalized and the left TA CDUS was negative, the halo sign remains in the contralateral TA.

Considering her complex medical history and the persistence of the halo sign, I believe that further specialized cardiological evaluation is warranted.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Dr. Emily Clark","The reason for this referral is the confirmation of a GCA relapse. TA CDUS revealed bilateral halo signs and an intima-media thickness (IMT) of 0.7 cm.

I am referring a 14-year-old female patient who presented with dysphonia, which began approximately one year ago and progressively worsened. Laryngoscopy revealed a mass on the left false vocal cord, which was successfully removed using CO2 laser endoscopy. Histological examination confirmed it to be a circumscribed amyloidosis nucleus. A subsequent microlaryngoscopy and biopsies showed no recurrence, and her vocal function has returned to optimal.

The patient requires a follow-up with a specialist in laryngeal disorders to monitor for any potential recurrence of amyloidosis and to ensure continued optimal vocal function.

Thank you for your attention to this case.

A MAM test was performed and the A4 can be seen to occur after the P wave. The A4 is undersensed (amplitude falling below the A4 threshold) which is manifest by the lack of an AM marker. After adjusting the A4 threshold (lowered from 1.2 to 0.7 m/s2), adequate sensing of A4 is present (Figure ) and AM is appropriately annotated.

Mr. John Doe, a 41-year-old male, presented to our clinic with a two-day history of low visual acuity in his right eye. Initial examination revealed that his visual acuity was at the level of counting fingers due to Valsalva retinopathy. Upon further investigation, we noted massive macular preretinal hemorrhage alongside scattered superior subretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages. Nd: YAG laser membranotomy was conducted, resulting in complete drainage of the preretinal blood, subsequently improving his visual acuity to 20/25.

I am writing to refer Ms. Jane Doe, a 51-year-old female dentist, for further evaluation and management of her occupational laryngitis. Despite extensive workup and negative test results, her symptoms persist.

Patient Information:
Name: Jane Doe
Age: 51
Gender: Female
Occupation: Dentist
Diagnosis: Occupational Laryngitis

Ms. Doe has been exposed to acrylics in her dental practice for the past 27 years, with symptoms present for 23 years. Despite negative tests for common allergens and acrylates, her condition has not improved. Spirometry and other evaluations were normal, indicating a non-specific inflammatory or irritant-induced condition.

The referral reason is to consider alternative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for Ms. Doe’s persistent symptoms of occupational laryngitis. Further expertise and intervention are required to manage her condition effectively.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me for any further information.

The angiography revealed an unligated thick side-branch of the left mammary artery with a high run-off, contributing to the string sign of the main branch of the mammary graft. The possibility of an intervention for the occlusion of the side-branch was considered.

However, due to aggressive medical therapy, the patient is currently free of angina. We seek your expert opinion regarding the significance of the original LAD lesion and the potential intervention for the side-branch occlusion.

The patient, an 8-year-old boy, was diagnosed with congenital pseudarthrosis forearm type II affecting both the radius and ulna. Following surgical procedures including resection and Ilizarov external fixation/traction, a secondary free fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap was harvested and transferred to cover the tissue defects.

The reason for referral is to provide specialized follow-up care to assess the integration and healing of the fibula flap, as well as to ensure continued functional recovery of the affected forearm. The expertise of a specialized orthopedic surgeon is required due to the complexity and rarity of the condition.

I am writing to refer a 32-year-old female patient, Ms. Emily Johnson, for further specialized psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Ms. Johnson has a history of psychological issues dating back to her adolescence.

Ms. Johnson has previously spent a year in an adolescent psychiatric unit and received psychotherapy for an eating disorder. Between the ages of 14 and 21, she engaged in acts of deliberate self-harm (DSH), including cutting with objects such as glass and blades and self-poisoning. These acts resulted in numerous scars on her left, nondominant upper and lower arm. Scar reconstruction surgery was performed on her left forearm.

The reason for this referral is Ms. Johnson's ongoing need for specialized psychiatric support to address her history of self-harm and underlying psychological issues. Continued treatment is crucial to her long-term mental health and well-being.

I am referring Patient I.1, a 37-year-old woman with a comprehensive medical history, for further evaluation.

Patient I.1 has experienced recurrent episodes of rhino-conjunctivitis from an early age. At age 4, she had multiple episodes of otitis, sinusitis, and bronchitis. She also had an episode of meningococcal septicaemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and skin complications at age 16. Recent years have shown a decline in the severity of infections, but she continues to experience flare-ups, including an acute episode of arthritis. Family history indicates that her mother, sister, and brother also have similar symptoms and have been studied previously.

The referral is for a comprehensive immunological and rheumatological evaluation to identify underlying conditions contributing to her recurrent infections and arthritis.

    The patient was a 71-year-old female with past history of pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple) performed at an outside hospital for a pancreatic mass eleven years prior to the current report. A diagnosis of benign inflammatory pancreatic mass of undetermined etiology was made. She presented at our institution for evaluation of hypertension; her serum creatinine was within normal range at 0.56 mg/dL (0.4_0.9 mg/dL). Computed tomography showed a 2.5 cm, circumscribed, enhancing mass in the right mid kidney near the hilar. This mass was presumed to represent a renal carcinoma and a nephrectomy was performed.

I am writing to refer a 15-year-old male patient who is a dedicated baseball player. The patient presented with repeated and severe lower back pain (LBP) that caused significant sleep disturbances. Despite undergoing conservative treatments such as the use of a hard brace, the symptoms did not improve.

CT imaging confirmed terminal-stage spondylolysis on the right side and laminolysis on the left side. Surgical intervention was performed, which led to a successful bony union and resolution of the LBP. Subsequently, the patient was able to resume playing baseball.

    Abdominal enhanced CT was conducted in a 63-year-old male due to the space-occupying location in the hepatic left lobe and the presence of cholecystolithiasis, as confirmed by an ultrasound examination. The bilateral renal veins extended out a large thick vascular shadow downward. They were accompanied by the downward abdominal aorta at the bilateral sides of the abdominal aorta, which branched into the iliac veins at the lumbar 5 vertebral level. Over the right renal vein level, the bilateral renal veins extended out as a normal running IVC (). This condition was diagnosed as double IVC.

Dear Dr. Doe,

I am referring Mr. Robert Smith, a 48-year-old male, who was evaluated in August 2011 for a non-tender, soft mass in the left parotid region. The ultrasound revealed a nonhomogenous hypoechogenic mass with anechogenic areas measuring 21x12 mm. After undergoing parotidectomy, he has shown no signs of tumor recurrence or metastasis during the 16 months follow-up.

The reason for this referral is the need for specialized follow-up to monitor any potential recurrence of the parotid mass. Given the initial findings and surgical intervention, continued vigilance is essential to promptly address any emerging concerns.

Please find attached the relevant medical records for your review. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

    A 30-year-old male with BB injuries at multiple sites and an entry wound at the glabella presented for ophthalmic evaluation within six hours of injury. An NCCT scan was suggestive of a metallic FB in the anterior orbit, adjacent to the left medial rectus. On surgical exploration, the FB could not be retrieved, and a coexisting lower canalicular injury was repaired with silicon tube intubation. The postoperative CT scan was suggestive of posterior migration of the foreign body. No further intervention was attempted. The BCVA was 20/20 OU, pre- as well as post-operatively. No extraocular motility limitations were seen.

Patient Information:
Name: John Smith
Age: 30
Gender: Male

John presented with BB injuries at multiple sites, including an entry wound at the glabella. An NCCT scan indicated a metallic foreign body in the anterior orbit, adjacent to the left medial rectus muscle. During surgical exploration, we were unable to retrieve the foreign body, and a coexisting lower canalicular injury was managed with silicon tube intubation. Postoperative CT scans suggested that the foreign body had posteriorly migrated. The patient's best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) remains stable at 20/20 OU, with no extraocular motility limitations observed.

The reason for referral is the posterior migration of the metallic foreign body within the orbit, which necessitates specialized ophthalmic surgical intervention beyond our current capacity.

The patient requires further evaluation by a specialist in dermatology to ascertain the underlying cause of his persistent skin condition. Notably, a sample from the external skin of the throat region has been submitted for microbiological culture, and its results may be of interest for a comprehensive diagnosis.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

    A 72-year-old female patient with disk hernias at the L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral space complained of pain in the lumbar area irradiating to the lower limbs that prevented her from walking. She was attending her third and final session in 18 months, with progressive improvement of her condition. The patient was on medication for hypertension (metoprolol 100 mg) and type II diabetes (metformin 850 mg). The patient regained her walking ability two weeks after the session, referring to moderate pain only when lifting heavy objects.

    Case 1__ystemic Ni allergy syndrome [].\nA 48-year-old woman presented with an inflamed esophagus. Ni allergy was diagnosed through patch testing. A Ni-free diet reversed symptoms while an oral Ni challenge induced adverse gastrointestinal effects. An oral desensitization therapy with slowly increasing amounts of Ni led to a complete reversal of symptoms. This case illustrates how metal-containing foods may cause systemic symptoms in metal allergic patients. It is an indication that oral desensitization may work similarly to hypo-sensitization for protein-related allergies, for example to pollen.

I am writing to refer my patient, a 5-year-old girl, who has been under our care since the age of 3 months. At that time, she presented with a pale face, fever, and cough. Her examinations revealed anemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and bronchitis. A widened interval outside the cerebrum was also noted on CT imaging. These findings were primarily attributed to suspected Evans syndrome and a viral infection.

    Patient 1 was a 3-month-old girl. She was admitted to the hospital due to pale face for 2 weeks, fever, and cough for 2 days. Detailed physical examination and laboratory tests revealed that the patient had anemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and bronchitis. Widened interval outside the cerebrum was noted in computed tomography. These clinical features were mainly attributed to suspected Evans syndrome and viral infection. The patient is 5 years old now and shows no sign of physical or psychomotor retardation.

    Patient 1. A 61-year-old male with cerebral hemorrhage presented to the emergency department in March 2011. After hematoma cleaning, he developed catheter-associated urinary tract infection. The patient was empirically treated with intravenous cefuroxime for 2 weeks with resolution of fever, then switched to oral cefradine. Urine culture on hospital day 6 grew carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (KP1-S). Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (KP1-R) was isolated from the urine on day 30. No other multidrug-resistant isolates were isolated after this.

He underwent a gross total resection and pathology confirmed a diagnosis of GBM with both astrocytic and oligodendroglial features, MGMT unmethylated, IDH1 wild-type and no loss of 1p19q. He was treated with conventional chemo-RT and opted to add TTFields to his maintenance temozolomide.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am referring Mr. Robert Thompson, a 46-year-old male, who has been diagnosed with gastric cancer. The patient presented with fatigue, weight loss, anemia, and dyspeptic complaints over the last two months. Subsequent diagnostic evaluations have revealed a serious health condition that requires specialized care.

The referral is due to findings from an upper endoscopic biopsy which confirmed gastric cancer. Further staging with FDG-PET/CT has demonstrated not only increased FDG accumulation at the primary tumor site but also multiple metastatic intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies and a left supraclavicular lymph node. Additionally, there is widespread heterogeneous FDG uptake in the axial skeleton indicative of bone marrow involvement. The patient's hemoglobin was recorded at 9.5 g/dL, WBC at 4,100, and PLT at 33,000 per µL. A bone marrow biopsy has shown metastatic gastric cancer.

Open surgical approach was considered appropriate as long as malignancy could not be excluded definitely. Right adrenalectomy was finally performed and pathological examination showed a 7 _ 5 _ 4 cm adrenal myelolipoma composed of mature adipose tissue and hematopoietic cells and weighting 250 g. On the tumor periphery a narrow zone of healthy adrenal tissue was observed. The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day, and remains disease free three years later.

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 36-year-old male, who presented to our Angiology service with a venous ulcer on his right lower limb. His physical examination revealed a plain angioma more prominent on the right side of his body, particularly the lower limb, along with verrucous nevi and angiokeratomas on the lateral surface of his foot.

We performed a color Doppler ultrasound of his right lower limb, which showed varicose veins without signs of arteriovenous fistula, confirming the diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS). We initiated treatment with phlebotonics and lymphokinetic drugs and conducted biannual follow-ups for his ulcer care.

Given the complexity of Mr. Doe's condition and the persistence of his ulcer despite our interventions, we recommend specialized evaluation and management by your service. Your expertise in advanced vascular conditions would be invaluable in optimizing his treatment plan.

    A 66-year-old female patient underwent surgery because of a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Just prior to the fundal wrap of the Nissen fundoplication, the patient suddenly became tachycardic and profoundly hypotensive. Emergency sternotomy revealed hemopericardium and a 2-cm laceration of the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle, which was controlled by placement of several sutures. The authors believed that the injury to the heart was secondary to a perforating needle on the contracting ventricle. The patient could be discharged from hospital on postoperative day 21.

We are referring a 66-year-old female patient who recently underwent surgery for a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Postoperative recovery was complicated by a sudden onset of tachycardia and profound hypotension, necessitating emergency sternotomy.

The referral is necessitated by the occurrence of a hemopericardium due to a 2-cm laceration of the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle, which was controlled by sutures. Given the complexity and severity of the injury, further cardiological evaluation and monitoring are recommended.

The patient has been discharged on postoperative day 21 and is stable, but requires specialized follow-up care.

At the age of 18 months, his parents noticed social communication impairments, including eye-to-eye gazing, facial expression, and language understanding. At the age of 3.5 years, he was diagnosed with autism. When he was 8 years old, he developed a sleep disorder and melatonin treatment was started. The Wechsler Intelligence Score for Children test, performed at 11 years of age, revealed a full scale IQ of 71, verbal IQ of 66, and performance IQ of 83. He now attends a special-needs school.

I am writing to refer a 5-month-old baby girl, diagnosed with right unilateral hydronephrosis (HDN) during an antenatal ultrasonography (USG). Postnatal USG confirmed right HDN, further corroborated by Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) and DTPA scans which indicated right pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction. During surgical exploration, a malfunctioning ureteral structure (MUS) was identified, and a ureteroureterostomy was performed using a double J (DJ) stent.

I am writing to refer Ms. Jane Doe, a 22-year-old primigravida who recently delivered a stillborn baby at 8 months of gestation. The patient is in need of further evaluation and specialized care.

Ms. Doe's antenatal scan revealed severe oligohydramnios, and the kidneys were not visualized. The stillborn had Potter facies and sirenomelia dipus, with notable congenital anomalies including hypoplastic lungs, colonic atresia, and absence of the right kidney, urinary bladder, external genitalia, and anal orifice.

She was admitted in July 2011 and trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) suggested an ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD) (2.2 cm in diameter) with left to right intracardiac shunt, and a 0.2 cm mitral valve cleft with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The interventricular septum was intact. The pulmonary artery pressure was 38 mmHg and mild tricuspid regurgitation was present. She was diagnosed with partial AVSD.

    Case 1. A 52-year-old man with bamboo spine had been experiencing middle back pain and neck stiffness for more than 20 years. The patient was HLA-B7 and B61 positive. His cervical spine had the typical characteristics of bamboo spine (Fig. left), and a syndesmophyte was present in the lumbar spine. The Modified New York radiological sacroiliitis criteria were grade 4 (bilateral) (Fig. right). Serum CRP, ESR, and IL-6 levels were elevated before adalimumab therapy, and improved to normal levels after the therapy. The BASDAI score improved remarkably, from 7.9 to 2.2 after the first injection.

Mr. Thompson has multiple metastases in the liver, peritoneum, and lungs. Following a single course of palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2), he developed a high fever and was hospitalized in poor general health.

No other pathogens were identified in blood cultures.

A cervical approach was used to reach the submandibular space (right size). The intubation was difficult because of the cervical tumefaction, and it was not possible to perform nasotracheal intubation. The patient woke up with dysphonia, tongue deviation toward the affected side (right size), lingual motility disturbance, and swallowing difficulty. Treatment with barium swallow radiograph excluded the presence of tracheoesophageal fistula.

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 36-year-old Caucasian male, who recently underwent surgical drainage of a neck abscess originating from teeth 47 and 48. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation. Due to cervical tumefaction, nasotracheal intubation was not possible. Postoperatively, the patient presented with dysphonia, tongue deviation towards the right side, lingual motility disturbance, and swallowing difficulty. A barium swallow radiograph ruled out tracheoesophageal fistula, and a thorough neurological examination along with fibroscopy identified nerve paralysis.

The referral is primarily due to the postoperative nerve paralysis which has led to significant dysphonia, lingual motility issues, and difficulty in swallowing. The patient's current symptoms necessitate further specialized evaluation and potential intervention by a neurologist.

I am referring a 12-year-old female patient, born at 36-week gestation via caesarean section. She has a history of epilepsy and reflux since 3 months of age. On physical examination, she presents with thumb brachydactyly, long fingers, retrognathia, short philtrum, and large ears. Her birth weight was 3020 g and she was born to a 42-year-old mother and 45-year-old father.

The reason for this referral is her complex symptomatology and the need for further specialized evaluation to determine any underlying genetic conditions that might explain her physical anomalies and epilepsy.

Her family history is noteworthy for a sister with a heart malformation.

He underwent an MRI which revealed a split type tear of the peroneus brevis tendon and a plantar calcaneal heel spur.

I am referring a 4-year-old Caucasian male of Turkish nationality who presented with abdominal pain and biliary vomiting for three days. Physical examination revealed abdomen tenderness and rigidity. An X-ray showed air-fluid levels indicative of intestinal obstruction, and ultrasonic imaging (USG) demonstrated masses in the intestinal lumen. During surgery, necrosis of approximately 20 cm of the ileum was found, which was resected and two Ascaris masses evacuated. Primary end-to-end anastomosis was performed, and the patient was discharged on the 7th day postoperatively without complications.

The patient requires a follow-up assessment to ensure complete recovery and to identify any potential complications arising from the surgical resection and anastomosis, such as infection or intestinal adhesion. Your expertise in pediatric gastroenterology would be greatly beneficial for his continued care.

Physical examination, mammography, ultrasonography, and MRI confirmed a well-circumscribed tumor with rich vascularity. Fine-needle aspiration and core needle biopsy indicated invasive ductal carcinoma with multi-nucleated OGCs.

The patient underwent a partial mastectomy with a sentinel lymph node biopsy, which showed no metastasis. Postoperative staging was pT2 N0 M0, stage IIA.

Referral reason: Given the nature of her invasive ductal carcinoma and the need for ongoing specialized oncology treatment, I am referring Jane Doe to your esteemed care for further management and any necessary adjuvant therapy.

Thank you for your attention to this case.

Dr. John Williams","Given the nature of her invasive ductal carcinoma and the need for ongoing specialized oncology treatment, I am referring Jane Doe to your esteemed care for further management and any necessary adjuvant therapy."

    A 43-year-old Japanese male developed a sore throat over a period of 3 months. A tumor at the base of the tongue was detected by endoscopy. The pathological diagnosis was BCAC by biopsy. CT revealed that the clinical stage was T4aN0M0 (stage IVA). The diameter of the primary tumor was 29 mm. At first, one cycle of chemotherapy, including cisplatin, 5-FU and docetaxel, was performed in the previous hospital; however, the tumor did not show shrinkage. He therefore came to our institution for C-ion RT.

Please find below the details of my patient:

A 45-year-old woman, a farmer by profession, presented with a 20 cm x 9 cm plaque on the sole and lateral borders of her right leg. The lesion has a distinct ridge at the periphery and started on her right ankle as a small coin-shaped annular lesion about 15 years ago, gradually spreading to involve the plantar and lateral surfaces of her right foot. She typically works in fields with bare feet. There is no family history of this disease. Based on these observations, the patient has been provisionally diagnosed with giant PK.

Given the complexity and progression of this condition, I am referring her to your specialized care for further evaluation and appropriate management.

Mr. Thompson sustained a left-sided stroke 18 years ago resulting in right hemiparesis. Due to financial constraints, he was only able to begin consistent therapy one year ago.

Due to lower lobe pneumonia and sepsis, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Notably, she did not respond adequately to midazolam.

Referral Reason: Given her complex medical history, including the necessity for mechanical ventilation and her non-response to midazolam, she requires further specialized neurological evaluation and management. She is currently stabilized and seizure-free on phenytoin sodium and clobazam. Continued care in a specialized center is recommended for optimal management of her condition.

Thank you for your attention to this referral. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further details.

    A 60-years-old lady presented with seizures leading to status epilepticus and left-hemiparesis for 3 days. She had left face/arm clonic seizures spreading to other side every few minutes. She had received lorazepam, loading dose of phenytoin sodium, levetiracetam, sodium valproate, and clobazam. In view of lower lobe pneumonia and sepsis, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated. She did not respond to midazolam (0.3 mg/kg/h). After 2 days of initiating classic KD, ketosis and seizure cessation were achieved. The KD was gradually weaned over 18 days. At 1 month, she was seizure free on phenytoin sodium and clobazam.

Dear Dr. Smith,
I am writing to refer Ms. Maria Rossi, a 32-year-old Italian woman with a complex medical history for further evaluation and management.

Maria has a history of the classic triad manifestations, enteropathy, and pernicious anemia. She was hospitalized in February 2020 for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with significant complications including ICU admission for hypoxemia, mechanical ventilation for 6 days, secondary pneumococcal pneumonia, and sepsis-induced ventricular dysfunction. She was treated with corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite her intensive treatment and subsequent recovery, 2 months post-discharge, her pulmonary function remains significantly impaired, with a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide at 55% of the expected value.

The reason for referral is to address her persistently impaired pulmonary function. Her condition necessitates specialized pulmonary evaluation and management to prevent further deterioration and to optimize her respiratory outcomes.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Patient's Details:
Name: John Doe
Age: 58
Gender: Male

The patient presented with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. A CT scan indicated a left hilar lesion, raising suspicion for lung carcinoma. A subsequent whole-body FDG PET/CT scan revealed an FDG avid lesion in the left hilar region, multiple FDG avid metastatic lesions, and an FDG avid lesion involving the left lamina of the thyroid cartilage with an associated soft tissue component. A biopsy of the left hilar mass confirmed the diagnosis of left lung carcinoma.

Given the diagnosis, I believe Mr. Doe requires comprehensive oncological evaluation and management. The presence of metastatic lesions necessitates a systemic treatment approach, and your expertise in oncology would be greatly beneficial for this patient.

    Case 1: A 35-year-old female with known repetitive gastric ulcers presented with abdominal pain and nausea visited our outpatient clinic (Gastroenterology). Initially, the clinician may suspect a recurrence of the gastric ulcers. Though the patient denied the possibility of pregnancy, the use of a pocket-sized US device confirmed the pregnancy. The proper use of the pocket-sized US device led to reduced ionizing radiation exposure and allowed to the transfer of the patient to the gynecology section (Figure ).

I am writing to refer Ms. Jane Doe, a 50-year-old female, who has been experiencing severe abdominal pain. On examination, her pain was graded as 10/10 on the DPVS scale. An ultrasound revealed a bulky pancreas, and her amylase levels were significantly elevated at 1240 IU. She was initially administered fentanyl and diclofenac intravenously for pain relief, followed by an ESPB due to intractable pain, which provided substantial relief within 30 minutes and lasted for 11 hours.

The reason for this referral is the potential presence of a serious underlying pancreatic pathology, necessitating further specialized evaluation and management by a gastroenterologist. An expedited appointment would be highly appreciated to ensure timely and appropriate intervention.

I am writing to introduce an 8-year-old girl who suffered a grade 2 car-tire injury to her leg. The initial wound appeared clean, and progressive granulation was observed with regular dressing changes. On post-trauma day (PTD) 40, the granulation tissue was excised, and debridement was performed. An artificial dermis, accompanied by a split-thickness skin graft (STSG), was applied to cover the raw surface. During a 5-year follow-up period, no secondary deformity was noted, and the surgical outcome has been excellent.

The reason for this referral is to ensure the continued monitoring and management of the graft site for any potential long-term complications. Given the patient's excellent recovery thus far, I believe ongoing surveillance is critical to maintaining the surgical outcome's integrity.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

I am writing to refer a 2-year-old girl, Emma White, who was admitted within 2 hours of accidental ingestion of carbolic acid resulting in an 8% burn injury of her body surface area. The burns involved her lips, tongue, face, and chest. Fortunately, her pharynx and airway were not compromised. 

The reason for referral is to provide specialized burn care and continued monitoring to prevent any further complications. Despite initial irritability and drooling, Emma has displayed remarkable improvement and is now able to consume liquids and solids without difficulty. However, her condition warrants more expert evaluation and management.

Lips, tongue as well as part of the face, and chest were involved due to spillage, but pharynx and airway were spared. She was irritable and had drooling of saliva but no other systemic complications or airway-related issues. Glycerine was applied over the exposed skin as local therapy to prevent further absorption of carbolic acid.

    Case 1: A 28-year-old-female presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Physical exam was significant for right-up-quadrant (RUQ) tenderness. Initial workup included abdominal US and computed tomography (CT), both of which were negative. She was admitted to the hospital for pain management and further workup. She subsequently underwent HIDA scan with cholecystokinin (CCK) which, like the previous imaging studies, was negative. Due to persistent pain, the decision was made to proceed with cholecystectomy for clinical cholecystitis. She underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy with resolution of symptoms post-operatively. At 10 months post-operatively, she remains symptom free.

I am writing to refer Mrs. Jane Doe, a 45-year-old female, who presented to our clinic with a concerning ocular condition. She experienced a sudden decrease in vision over the past 10 days, with her visual acuity measuring 6/24 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye at initial presentation. Fundoscopic examination revealed a large central subinternal limiting membrane (ILM) hemorrhage in conjunction with a subhyaloid hemorrhage beneath the fovea and a breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage. A rebleed occurred three weeks later, reducing her vision to 2/60 OD, which subsequently recovered to 6/6 OD after the hemorrhage spontaneously resolved in six weeks.

I am writing to refer Ms. Sarah Johnson, a 47-year-old multiparous female. Ms. Johnson recently underwent diagnostic mammography and breast ultrasound, which revealed a high-density irregular lesion with microcalcifications in the retroareolar and medial aspect of her breast. This lesion was categorized as BIRADS grade 5.

Patient Information:
Name: Ms. Sarah Johnson
Age: 47 years
Gender: Female
Medical History: Multiparous, high-density irregular lesion in breast

The referral is necessary due to the confirmed diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The core biopsy indicated malignant features, including marked hypoechogenicity and microlobulations. The urgency of the referral is underscored by the presence of microcalcifications and dilated anechoic ducts in the retroareolar region, although no satellite lesions or axillary lymph nodes were detected.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The lesion was fortuitously discovered 19 years ago, and the patient was treated with alendronate. He is currently asymptomatic, though he occasionally experiences minor pain.

Patient Info:
Name: E.M.

The referral is specifically for the management of the patient's impingement syndrome in the left shoulder, which has arisen due to bone deformities secondary to Paget's disease. Although he is regularly followed up in the orthopedics department, a more specialized assessment and potential intervention for his shoulder condition is necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am referring to you a 4-month-old female patient named Emily Thompson who presented with right macrostomia and a preauricular skin tag. She was diagnosed with right Tessier number 7 craniofacial cleft.

The reason for this referral is to further evaluate and manage the complexities associated with her craniofacial cleft, particularly to monitor her developmental progress and to potentially plan for further surgical interventions if required.

Emily underwent excision and primary closure for the right preauricular skin tag. The macrostomia correction was designed with a 1-mm medial overcorrection compared to the normal side, and the procedure involved Z-plasty during skin closure. 

Your expertise in pediatric craniofacial anomalies will be invaluable in ensuring her comprehensive treatment and long-term outcomes.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer an 18-year-old female patient who presented with menstrual disturbances and has been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Her diagnosis is supported by clinical findings of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, oligo/hypomenorrhea, and biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated total testosterone of 91.5 ng/dl, elevated free testosterone of 4.5 pg/ml, and elevated androstenedione of 3.9 ng/ml. Additionally, her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 6.3 mIU/ml, and her prolactin level was 820 mIU/ml.

The primary reason for this referral is to seek an endocrinological evaluation and management plan due to the elevated androgen levels and abnormal thyroid and prolactin levels, which may require specialized care.

Thank you for your attention to this case. Please let me know if you need any further information.

Ultrasonography was performed with the 12-MHz linear array transducer of an iU22 scanner (Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA, USA). Grayscale ultrasonography showed a mass in the left groin composed of dilated, echo-free, tubular channels. The color Doppler ultrasonography identified a mass composed of multiple echo-free tubular channels with hypervascularity that became more prominent during a Valsalva maneuver. There was no ultrasonographic evidence of a herniated bowel or lymphadenopathy (, ). The patient was treated conservatively.

    A 76-year-old woman presented complaining of severe right hip joint pain. Plain radiographs of the affected joint showed mild OA of KL grading I (Fig. ). Within a month after pain onset, hip MRI displayed broad and heterogeneous low intensity in T1W and high intensity in STIR images (Fig. , ). At more than 6 months after onset, hip MRI disclosed a local signal (Fig. , ) and plain radiographs revealed progressed OA of KL grading II (Fig. ). Since her joint pain persisted, she ultimately underwent right hip joint replacement surgery.

    This 45-year-old male patient with metastatic rectal cancer and neuropathic pain (DN4 score of 5) was unresponsive to intrathecal morphine 12 mg/day (VAS score of 8). Intrathecal ziconotide 0.5 μg/day was added to therapy in April 2009. The patient was also receiving oral gabapentin 900 mg every 8 h, amitriptyline 25 mg every 24 h, and transdermal fentanyl 200 μg. Intrathecal ziconotide was administered for 10 months with no adverse events. At his last assessment, the patient was receiving ziconotide 10 μg/day plus morphine 12 μg/day, and his VAS score was five. The patient died in February 2010.

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 45-year-old male, who has been under our care for metastatic rectal cancer with significant neuropathic pain. Despite an extensive pain management regimen including intrathecal morphine and oral gabapentin, his pain levels have remained inadequately controlled.

The reason for this referral is to seek your expert opinion on additional pain management strategies, particularly given the complexity and refractoriness of his symptoms. We have tried various treatments including intrathecal ziconotide, which improved his VAS score marginally, but his current regimen is still insufficient for effective pain relief.

Thank you in advance for your assistance with this challenging case.

I am writing to refer an 8-year-old male patient, James Doe, who recently underwent an appendicectomy following ingestion of a metallic screw. Approximately three months ago, James ingested a metallic screw. Despite being asymptomatic, follow-up radiographs showed the screw lodged in the right lower quadrant.

I am writing to refer a 7-year-old male patient with a documented history of Kawasaki disease treated conservatively at the age of 1 year, who is now presenting with significant cardiovascular issues.

The patient currently exhibits shortness of breath classified as NYHA class 3. Recent echocardiography findings are suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of 30%. The angiogram shows a normal RCA but a cut-off in the mid part of the LMCA with collateral filling from the right coronary. Cardiac stress testing further indicated the presence of provocable ischemia.

The reason for this referral is to evaluate the patient for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Given the complexity of his condition and the confirmed ischemia, your expertise in cardiothoracic surgery is vital for determining the appropriate surgical interventions.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. Please let us know if you require any additional information.

Kind regards,

Dr. Jane Smith
Pediatric Cardiologist

    A 45-year-old female was referred to the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology. She was diagnosed as a case of chronic periodontitis and had a mean probing depth of 6.5 mm. Scaling and root planing (SRP) was advised as part of initial therapy. The patient had discomfort during SRP in the maxillary anterior region; hence AMSA nerve block was administered. SRP was performed using ultrasonic and manual instrumentation. In both the quadrants depth of anesthesia and the duration was adequate to complete the procedure. The patient did not experience any discomfort while root planing. The lips were not anesthetized.

Her computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a hyperdense, contrast enhancing anterior third ventricle lesion, causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Bilateral shunt tubes were seen in the lateral ventricles. She underwent bilateral shunt revisions, and was relieved of her symptoms. On 1 year follow-up she continues to be asymptomatic.

    A 34-year-old man presented with intermittent right flank pain for 6 months. Preliminary ultrasound for suspected calculus disease showed right hydroureteronephrosis with a dilated proximal ureter but no evidence of calculi. Excretory urography showed right-sided grade 4 hydroureteronephrosis, the ureter being dilated up to the L4 vertebral level, with a tapered segment seen coursing superiomedially. A diagnosis of circumcaval ureter was suggested, and MRU was performed. MRU showed grade 4 hydronephrosis with the medialized segment of the ureter coursing around the IVC, and axial sections clearly depicted the anatomy [].

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 60-year-old male, who presented in our department with a unique case. He has a history of cardiac transplantation and has been on immunosuppressive therapy for several years.

Mr. Doe developed a cauliflower-like tumor mass in the perianal region in June 2009. Detailed examination showed no propagation into the anal canal, but the lesion increased in size, causing difficulty in walking and sitting. Consequently, a large surgical excision was performed, and the area was reconstructed using a bilateral rotation S-plasty flap. Although his postoperative course was complicated by an unilateral hematoma and subsequent partial dehiscence of the flap, the wound was managed with daily wound cleansing, resulting in a satisfactory final outcome.

The reason for this referral is to ensure ongoing specialized care and follow-up management. Mr. Doe's complex medical history and recent surgical intervention warrant continued surveillance by a specialist in this field.

Thank you for your attention to this patient.

We are referring a 2-month-old female patient with a significant medical history related to a facial hemangioma. The patient’s details are as follows: 

Name: Jane Doe
Age: 9 months
Gender: Female

The patient was initially treated in our clinic for a prominent hemangioma on her face, which involved the superior right eyelid. Propranolol therapy was introduced, leading to substantial reduction and near-complete healing of the lesion within 6 months. Follow-up eye examinations indicated no impairment in visual function, strabismus, astigmatism, or amblyopia.

The reason for referral is the recent development of a red telangiectatic macula at the prior hemangioma site. Given the current response and the planned tapering off of Propranolol after she reaches 18 months of age, a specialist's opinion is required to ensure optimal long-term management.

The patient has undergone MRI evaluation, which has highlighted a malignant mass in the right middle lobe, suspicious of pericardial invasion—a finding that was subsequently confirmed during surgery.

The primary reason for this referral is to seek your expertise in the further management and potential treatment options for Mr. Doe’s malignant condition, given the complexity and extent of the disease as evidenced by T2-weighted and ECG-gated imaging techniques.

I appreciate your timely attention to this matter and am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Dr. Emily Harris

    ",False,"Dear Specialist,

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 27-year-old male, who has been experiencing progressive hair loss from the scalp over the past 6 months. He also reports itching and a slight burning sensation.

Patient Name: John Doe 
Age: 27 
Gender: Male 

On examination, Mr. Doe presents with well-defined purplish plaques with atrophy of the skin, primarily affecting the vertex and extending to the parietal areas. Trichoscopy revealed perifollicular scales, diminished follicular ostia, and white dots. Additionally, blue-grey dots around the follicular structures appeared as a target pattern. Histopathology is consistent with a diagnosis of Lichen Planopilaris (LPP).

The reason for this referral is further evaluation and management of Lichen Planopilaris (LPP), which has not responded adequately to initial treatment. Your expertise in dermatologic care is highly sought after to devise an appropriate management plan.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jane Smith","The reason for this referral is further evaluation and management of Lichen Planopilaris (LPP), which has not responded adequately to initial treatment. Your expertise in dermatologic care is highly sought after to devise an appropriate management plan."
