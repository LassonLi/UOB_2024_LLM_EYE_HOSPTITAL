Dear Dr. Brown,

I am referring Mr. John Doe, a 45-year-old male, with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus for further evaluation.

Mr. Doe has recently exhibited symptoms including persistent chest pain and shortness of breath, which have not responded adequately to initial management. His recent ECG shows signs suggestive of myocardial ischemia, and his blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments.

Given the above, I believe it is crucial for Mr. Doe to be evaluated by a cardiology specialist for further diagnostic testing and management to prevent any potential cardiac events.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Re: Referral for Rheumatology Consultation

Dear Dr. Lee,

I am writing to refer Mr. John Smith, a 45-year-old male patient, to your expertise for further evaluation. Mr. Smith has a history of obesity and hypertension but is otherwise a generally healthy individual.

Reason for Referral:

Mr. Smith has been experiencing persistent joint pain and swelling for the past three months. Despite initial management with NSAIDs and lifestyle modifications, his symptoms have progressively worsened, limiting his daily activities. Given these unrelenting symptoms and his elevated inflammatory markers, a comprehensive rheumatological assessment is warranted to rule out conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory joint diseases.

Attached to this letter are Mr. Smithâ€™s recent lab results and medical history for your review. Please feel free to reach out for any additional information.

    Case 1 is a 44-year-old male with no significant medical history before being diagnosed with HCV genotype 1b in 2014 (Table ). Before starting our treatment, his viral load was 10,400,000 IU/mL. The strategy SOF+RBV+PEG-IFN was given. The course of treatment was 12 weeks. He had a rapid virological response (RVR) with undetectable viral load at week 4 that remained undetectable for the remainder of 10 weeks of SOF-based triple therapy. The strategy SOF+RBV+PEG-IFN was stopped after the 12-week therapy. A sustained virologic response (SVR) was observed. The viral load remained undetectable until SVR24 (Table ).

    A 72-year-old man underwent left upper division segmentectomy because a ground-glass neoplasm was found in the left upper lobe (A). The lesion was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), TisN0M0, stage 0 (B). AIS is a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the survival rate after resection is reportedly 100% []. Three indels in the noncoding region of the SFTPB gene were detected (). The detection of noncoding indels in a case of such early, well-differentiated lung cancer suggested that noncoding indel mutations occur in the early phase of tumor evolution.

    This was a 32-year-old female patient who lost 219 lb after gastric bypass surgery. Her postbariatric weight was 185 lb. She had persistent skin sores bilaterally in her groin and also in her suprapubic region secondary to excess overhanging skin. No ADL interference was diagnosed. She was classified as type IA (Fig ). An infraumbilical panniculectomy with the need for umbilical transposition was carried out. Her 13-month follow-up showed complete resolution of the skin problems that she had prior to surgery (Fig ).

Though these sores do not interfere with her activities of daily living, they require specialized dermatological and possibly surgical intervention to prevent further complications.

An infraumbilical panniculectomy with umbilical transposition was carried out previously, and at her 13-month follow-up, there was complete resolution of her initial skin problems. Continuous monitoring and further treatment are essential for her ongoing recovery.

I am referring to you Mr. James Smith, a 28-year-old male who presented with gross hematuria and clots following a percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedure 7 days ago. He experienced a significant hemoglobin drop of 3gm/dl, which necessitated the administration of two units of blood transfusion.

The reason for this referral is the finding of a right lower pole segmental artery aneurysm identified via MDCT, which was associated with clots in the pelvicalyceal system.

Consequently, Ms. Brown was diagnosed with a triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma and subsequently had a total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and tissue expander reconstruction. The tumor was staged at pT1bN0M0 stage I.

The reason for this referral is to ensure continuous oncological management and further treatment planning for Ms. Brown's recently diagnosed breast cancer. Your expertise in oncology is crucial for her ongoing care and future surveillance.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 46-year-old male patient, for further oncological evaluation and management.


Mr. Doe has been experiencing fatigue, weight loss, anemia, and dyspeptic complaints for the last 2 months. After conducting an upper endoscopic biopsy, he was diagnosed with gastric cancer. An FDG-PET/CT scan revealed increased FDG accumulation at the primary tumor site along with multiple metastatic intraabdominal lymphadenopathies and a left supraclavicular lymph node. Additionally, heterogeneous widespread FDG uptake in the axial skeleton suggested bone marrow involvement. Laboratory results showed Hgb at 9.5 g/dL, WBC at 4,100 per ÂµL, and PLT at 33,000 per ÂµL. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed metastatic gastric cancer.

The reason for this referral is the complexity and advanced stage of Mr. Doe's gastric cancer, which requires specialized oncological care. Given the widespread metastasis, I believe an expert evaluation and treatment plan are crucial for his condition.

Thank you for your attention to this patient. Please feel free to contact me for any further information.

    A 58-year-old woman was admitted to another hospital because of melena. Abdominal CT revealed a pedunculated, polypoid lesion with fat density in the ileum. The patient was transferred to our hospital for close examination. This polypoid lesion was diagnosed as a lipoma. Retrograde DBE was performed for the purpose of endoscopic resection. A pedunculated polyp was found in the distal ileum. Endoscopic resection was performed. Histologic findings identified an inverted MD with ectopic pancreatic tissue. No adverse events occurred, including perforation or hemorrhage [].

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer Mrs. Helen Anderson, a 58-year-old woman, who was initially admitted to another hospital due to melena. An abdominal CT scan revealed a pedunculated, polypoid lesion with fat density in her ileum. She was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and was diagnosed with a lipoma. A retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) was conducted to perform an endoscopic resection. The procedure revealed a pedunculated polyp in the distal ileum, and endoscopic resection was successfully performed.

The referral reason: Mrs. Anderson requires follow-up care after the endoscopic resection. Histologic findings indicated an inverted Meckel's Diverticulum (MD) with ectopic pancreatic tissue, and it is essential to monitor for any potential complications, although none, such as perforation or hemorrhage, have occurred.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

    Case 1. A 47-year-old man underwent living-related renal transplantation for end-stage renal disease due to hypertension and nephrosclerosis. He was randomized to receive everolimus 1.5 mg/d, with basiliximab induction, cyclosporine, and steroids. Eleven months later, he developed mild intermittent dyspnea. The everolimus trough level was 5.3 ng/mL. After two months, a bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. He continued to receive everolimus. Four months after the initial symptoms of dyspnea, the patient died of pneumonia and sepsis.

Patient Details:
Name: Jane Doe
Age: 75
Gender: Female

Referral Reason:
I am referring Mrs. Jane Doe, a 75-year-old pseudophakic female, for further evaluation and continued management of her macular edema (ME) secondary to exudation from a macroaneurysm (RAM). Despite initial improvements with intravitreal aflibercept injections (IAI), sustained monitoring and potential future interventions may be needed to maintain her visual acuity and prevent recurrence of ME.

At baseline, her vision was 20/100 OD with a central subfield thickness (CST) of 337 Âµm. Post-treatment improvements included a reduction of CST to 296 Âµm and vision improvement to 20/50 at one month. Over the following 12 months, her visual acuity continued to improve to 20/25 without further interventions. Recent color photos and intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) showed thrombosis of the RAM with normal blood flow and resolution of ME on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

Thank you for your timely consideration.

Best regards,
Dr. John Brown","I am referring Mrs. Jane Doe, a 75-year-old pseudophakic female, for further evaluation and continued management of her macular edema (ME) secondary to exudation from a macroaneurysm (RAM).

I am referring a 37-year-old woman who has a 5-month history of chronic sinusitis without fever. She underwent an allogeneic allograft bone marrow transplant for idiopathic aplasia one year ago. A recent CT scan disclosed right maxillary sinusitis and left focal basal pneumonia, without cavitation. Cultures from bronchoalveolar fluid revealed the presence of Actinomyces spp.

The referral reason is to seek your expert evaluation and further management regarding her chronic sinusitis and recurrent respiratory symptoms post-transplant. Despite her initial response to surgical and antibiotic therapy, her persistent symptoms warrant specialized care in respiratory and infectious disease.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if there are any questions.

    A 78-year-old woman presented for a routine ophthalmological consultation reporting an uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery in a private clinic 3 years before. A hydrophobic acrylic IOL (AcrySofÂ®; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) was implanted in the capsular bag bilaterally. There was no known history of glaucoma or OHT. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 8/10 oculi uterque (OU) and intraocular pressure (IOP) was 18 mmHg in both eyes. Anterior segment biomicroscopy revealed XFM in the pupillary border and on the anterior surface of the IOL in the right eye (). Posterior segment examination was unremarkable.

    ",False,"Dear Colleague,

I hope this note finds you well. I am writing to refer Mrs. Jane Doe, a 67-year-old woman, for further evaluation and management.

Mrs. Doe is 153 cm tall and weighs 54 kg. She initially visited our hospital after a fall, which resulted in wrist fractures. She has been experiencing right hip joint pain and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) at KL grading III based on plain radiographs. Her pain levels have fluctuated over time, but she has recently reported significant pain reduction. Despite this, recent radiographs continue to show OA at KL grading III, though an MRI of her right hip joints reveals no signal changes.

Given her history of recurrent pain and existing osteoarthritis, I believe a specialized orthopedic evaluation is warranted to determine the appropriate management course.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Dr. John Smith","Given her history of recurrent pain and existing osteoarthritis, I believe a specialized orthopedic evaluation is warranted to determine the appropriate management course."

    The patient was a 12-year-old girl with benign pathologic lesion that involved soft palate. Posteriorly based buccinator myomucosal pedicle flap reconstructed the mucosal defect, immediately after resection [].\nThis flap relays on buccal artery (a branch of maxillary artery) for survival. Long buccal nerve accompanies this artery, therefore, it is neurovascular pedicle flap and sensory return is predictable. There was no need for pedicle base division. Donor site closed primarily.

I am writing to refer a patient to your specialized care.

Patient: Jane Doe
Age: 12 years
Gender: Female

The patient underwent a surgical procedure involving the resection of a benign pathologic lesion from the soft palate. The mucosal defect was successfully reconstructed using a posteriorly based buccinator myomucosal pedicle flap. This flap relies on the buccal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, for survival and is associated with the long buccal nerve to ensure predictable sensory return. There was no need for pedicle base division, and the donor site was closed primarily.

The referral is to ensure continued monitoring of the healing process and to evaluate sensory return in the operated region. Given the specificity of the flap and the involvement of the buccal artery and nerve, your expertise will be invaluable for the patient's ongoing care.

Best regards,
Dr. John Doe","The referral is to ensure continued monitoring of the healing process and to evaluate sensory return in the operated region. Given the specificity of the flap and the involvement of the buccal artery and nerve, your expertise will be invaluable for the patient's ongoing care."

Diamond Pediatric Clinic,

Dear Dr. Doe,

We are referring a 2-month-old female patient, Emily Brown, born at term, who presented with a protuberant hemangioma on her face, impinging on the superior right eyelid. Propranolol treatment was initiated with notable reduction and healing of the lesion over 6 months. At 9 months, Emily developed a red telangiectatic macula in the previously affected area. Currently, there are no signs of visual impairment, strabismus, astigmatism, or amblyopia.

The purpose of this referral is to consult on the red telangiectatic macula that developed in the previously affected area, and to discuss the plan to taper off propranolol when the child reaches 1 year and 6 months of age.

Thank you for your attention.
