I am referring a four-year-old male patient named Jimmy Brown for further urological evaluation and management. Jimmy was admitted to our hospital for uro-genital evaluation and was found to have diphallia with normal meatuses and an otherwise normal scrotum with one testis on each side. His karyotype is 46XY.

On further investigation, ultrasound and cystography revealed two independent bladders lying side by side, each emptying through a separate urethra. Hernia repair and cysto-urethro-phalloplasty have been performed in two stages.

Given the complexity of Jimmy's condition, he requires specialized care from a pediatric urologist for ongoing management and potential further intervention. Your expertise in this area would be greatly beneficial for optimal patient outcomes.

Thank you for your attention to this referral.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer Ms. Jane Doe, a 52-year-old female, for further evaluation of suspected Papilledema.

Patient Information:
Name: Ms. Jane Doe
Age: 52
Medical History: Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes
Visual Acuity: Right Eye: 20/30, Left Eye: 20/25

Referral Reason: During a routine eye examination, I observed swollen discs and indistinct margins in both of Ms. Doe's optic nerves. Her symptoms include headaches and transient visual obscurations. Given the severity of these findings, I believe that comprehensive neuro-ophthalmological assessment is essential to rule out any potential underlying conditions, such as increased intracranial pressure or other neurological issues.

I appreciate your expertise and timely intervention in this matter.

I am writing to refer Mrs. Jane Smith, a 64-year-old female, for further evaluation and management.

Mrs. Smith presented with back pain, normal renal function, and an unremarkable clinical history. A computed tomography scan revealed a 1 cm-diameter solid lesion in the upper pole of her right kidney. This lesion was successfully removed by partial nephrectomy. Histological examination identified the lesion as a vascular tumor. A follow-up 25 months post diagnosis indicates that Mrs. Smith is currently in good health, with no evidence of disease recurrence.

Given the patient's history of a vascular tumor in the kidney, this referral is for comprehensive oncological assessment to ensure ongoing monitoring and to preclude any potential complications or recurrences.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me for further information.

Patient Details:
Name: Jane Doe
Age: 75
Gender: Female

Referral Reason:
I am referring Mrs. Jane Doe, a 75-year-old pseudophakic female, for further evaluation and continued management of her macular edema (ME) secondary to exudation from a macroaneurysm (RAM). Despite initial improvements with intravitreal aflibercept injections (IAI), sustained monitoring and potential future interventions may be needed to maintain her visual acuity and prevent recurrence of ME.

At baseline, her vision was 20/100 OD with a central subfield thickness (CST) of 337 µm. Post-treatment improvements included a reduction of CST to 296 µm and vision improvement to 20/50 at one month. Over the following 12 months, her visual acuity continued to improve to 20/25 without further interventions. Recent color photos and intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) showed thrombosis of the RAM with normal blood flow and resolution of ME on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

Thank you for your timely consideration.

Dr. John Brown","I am referring Mrs. Jane Doe, a 75-year-old pseudophakic female, for further evaluation and continued management of her macular edema (ME) secondary to exudation from a macroaneurysm (RAM).

Dear Dr. Johnson,

I am writing to refer a 26-year-old woman, Emily Brown, to your care. Ms. Brown has a significant medical history involving a BRCA1 pathogenic variant and recent diagnosis of triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma.

Ms. Brown underwent annual breast screening MRI for four years. The latest MRI screening revealed a 9-mm oval circumscribed mass. MRI-targeted ultrasonography (US) showed a dilated duct collection, prompting us to perform a US-guided core needle biopsy (CNB). Consequently, Ms. Brown was diagnosed with a triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma and subsequently had a total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and tissue expander reconstruction. The tumor was staged at pT1bN0M0 stage I.

The reason for this referral is to ensure continuous oncological management and further treatment planning for Ms. Brown's recently diagnosed breast cancer. Your expertise in oncology is crucial for her ongoing care and future surveillance.

She responded well to propranolol treatment, which was discontinued at 1 year of age with resolution of the hemangioma and a small residual scar.

The reason for this referral is to ensure there is no recurrence of the hemangioma and to assess the small residual scar for any necessary cosmetic or medical intervention.

Please feel free to contact me for any further information or clarification.

I am writing to refer Mrs. Jane Doe, an 86-year-old woman, for further evaluation and management.

Mrs. Doe has been experiencing persistent right ankle pain. Radiographs and MRI findings indicate severe ankle osteoarthritis (KL grade IV).

Dear Dr. White,

I am referring Daisy Jones, a 4-year-old girl, for further evaluation. Daisy is the first child born to nonconsanguineous parents after a 39-week gestation through cesarean section. Her medical history includes hospitalization due to intermittent vomiting, fever, and diarrhea. There have been no observed growth or neuropsychiatric deficits, and physical exams revealed enhanced deep-tendon reflexes and Achilles clonus without pathological reflexes. Diagnostic tests such as X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and abdominal ultrasound were normal; however, an electroencephalogram (EEG) indicated mild abnormalities.

Referring Daisy to your expertise due to the persistent and unexplained neurological signs is recommended. Despite normal primary diagnostic tests, her enhanced reflexes, and clonus paired with EEG abnormalities could benefit from a detailed neurological assessment to rule out any underlying conditions that may require specialized interventions.

Thank you for your evaluation.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer Mrs. Helen Anderson, a 58-year-old woman, who was initially admitted to another hospital due to melena. An abdominal CT scan revealed a pedunculated, polypoid lesion with fat density in her ileum. She was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and was diagnosed with a lipoma.

The procedure revealed a pedunculated polyp in the distal ileum, and endoscopic resection was successfully performed.

I am writing to refer our patient, Mr. John Doe, a 38-year-old male with hypertension and a history of atrial fibrillation. Recent diagnostic tests including Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) revealed unexplained dilatation of the right ventricle in absence of an atrial septal defect (ASD) or other intracardiac shunt. Additionally, a peripheral dye dilution curve confirmed a significant left-to-right shunt (P/S 2.8).

Further imaging with axial Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) identified a small sinus venosus ASD and abnormal pulmonary vein drainage from the right upper lobe into the superior vena cava (SVC).

Given these findings, I am recommending further evaluation and management by a cardiologist with expertise in congenital heart diseases.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 46-year-old male patient, for further oncological evaluation and management.


Mr. Doe has been experiencing fatigue, weight loss, anemia, and dyspeptic complaints for the last 2 months. After conducting an upper endoscopic biopsy, he was diagnosed with gastric cancer. An FDG-PET/CT scan revealed increased FDG accumulation at the primary tumor site along with multiple metastatic intraabdominal lymphadenopathies and a left supraclavicular lymph node. Additionally, heterogeneous widespread FDG uptake in the axial skeleton suggested bone marrow involvement. Laboratory results showed Hgb at 9.5 g/dL, WBC at 4,100 per µL, and PLT at 33,000 per µL. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed metastatic gastric cancer.

The reason for this referral is the complexity and advanced stage of Mr. Doe's gastric cancer, which requires specialized oncological care. Given the widespread metastasis, I believe an expert evaluation and treatment plan are crucial for his condition.

Thank you for your attention to this patient. Please feel free to contact me for any further information.

Best regards,

Dr. Emily Watson.

Mr. Robert Smith has a solid and enhancing hypovascular renal mass, axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly with multiple splenic lesions, and spinal bone involvement.

The patient needs referral due to the solid renal mass, suggesting possible malignancy, combined with systemic involvement indicated by axillary adenopathy, splenic lesions, and bone metastases. Immediate oncological assessment and intervention are required.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

I am writing to refer Mr. John Smith, a 47-year-old male, for further evaluation and management.

Mr. Smith recently underwent resection of a basal cell carcinoma located on the left nasolabial fold. The carcinoma, measuring 1.5 cm in diameter, was successfully excised with a free margin of 0.5 cm. The resultant 2.5 cm diameter skin defect was reconstructed using a unilateral V-Y advancement flap. Notably, the reconstruction was aligned with the relaxed skin tension line (RSTL), ensuring minimal adjacent tissue deformity and achieving satisfactory cosmetic outcomes.

Given the nature of this reconstruction and to ensure optimal healing and cosmetic results, a specialist's review is warranted.

Ms. Rossi has a history of classic triad manifestations, enteropathy, and pernicious anemia. She was diagnosed with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia in February 2020 and was hospitalized for 37 days in Northern Italy. During her hospitalization, she experienced hypoxemia requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation for 6 days.

Patient: Jane Doe
Age: 12 years
Gender: Female

The patient underwent a surgical procedure involving the resection of a benign pathologic lesion from the soft palate. The mucosal defect was successfully reconstructed using a posteriorly based buccinator myomucosal pedicle flap. This flap relies on the buccal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, for survival and is associated with the long buccal nerve to ensure predictable sensory return. There was no need for pedicle base division, and the donor site was closed primarily.

The referral is to ensure continued monitoring of the healing process and to evaluate sensory return in the operated region. Given the specificity of the flap and the involvement of the buccal artery and nerve, your expertise will be invaluable for the patient's ongoing care.

I am writing to refer Mr. John Doe, a 58-year-old male, for further evaluation and management. He presents with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and has developed significant ulcers on the left buccal mucosa corresponding to the 35, 36, and 37 regions, measuring approximately 4 cm by 3 cm, and on the right buccal mucosa affecting the 45, 46, and 47 regions.

The primary reason for this referral is the presence of multiple, irregularly shaped ulcers with punched-out borders and surrounding inflammation, which are consistent with traumatic ulcers secondary to a cheek bite, but necessitate further investigation and specialist management to rule out other potential underlying conditions and to optimize healing.

Ms. Doe's condition included avulsion of the labial mucosa covering the vestibule and a lingually displaced fractured dentoalveolar segment.

The lost labial mucosa was successfully replaced with an inferiorly based partial thickness pedicled buccinator myomucosal flap. The pedicle was divided three weeks post-operatively.
